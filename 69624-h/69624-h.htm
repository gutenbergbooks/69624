    <div class='c000'>Found in the Cell of a Nun, after her Decease, in the Convent of Zurich.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Since Amabel Bloomberg traced the
letters which will be found with this,
how many years have elapsed! how
many changes have taken place! How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>many persons are now insensible dust,
who are described as agitated with such
anxious fears and ardent hopes, by the
pens of Amabel and the Damsels of
Sargans! Accident has also made me
mistress of the letters of those unfortunate
sisters. Accident, did I say? Surely,
it was something more than mere
chance, which brought them into the
hands of her, who is most able to supply
that chasm, which otherwise would
have been left in these adventures.</p>

<p class='c018'>To undertake this task I have both
leisure and information sufficient. My
fate was too closely united with that of
the sisters, to permit the slightest particular
concerning them to be concealed
from me; and jointly with theirs will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>my name be handed down to posterity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet is it not an idle vanity, a love of
worldly fame, which makes me desire
this species of immortality?—Well then,
I will repress the wish. Long practised
in self-denial, I will make even this last
sacrifice to my celestial spouse, and
will write, as if I treated of strangers
and of interests quite foreign to myself.
No one shall know my name except
Heaven, to whom alone is thoroughly
known, how much I have suffered!</p>

<p class='c018'>When I entered the world, the course
of innocence and beauty lay among a
thousand snares and pit-falls, which
were the more dangerous from being
most artfully concealed. This is a truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>which I learnt to my cost, before I
sought, and found, tranquillity in a
convent.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel was blind to those snares;
though they were spread carelessly
enough for her to have seen them, had
not her own guileless nature thrown a
veil over her eyes, and had not female
obstinacy made her reject the prudent
warnings of her best friends.</p>

<p class='c018'>The visit to Engelberg, which she
had agreed upon in concert with her
brother’s wife, was made the next day;
and the latter, as young, imprudent,
and unsuspicious as Amabel, undertook
to excuse her sister-in-law’s absence to
the jealous Arnold, and the sick old
man, who suffered no quarter of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>hour to pass without enquiring for his
daughter. However, Juttila engaged
to invent some means for satisfying him
till Amabel’s return, which was delayed
much longer than either of them intended.</p>

<p class='c018'>How indeed could she return so
speedily, since adventures encountered
her on the road, on which she little
reckoned, and whose nature was of sufficient
consequence to have a fearful influence
over herself, and over all those who
were most dear to her? Alas! the cottage
which she left with such a thoughtless
heart, she was destined to revisit
no more with such content: the fate of
the two sisters, which she was so eager
to learn, was now enveloped by such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>impenetrable darkness, that she in vain....
But I am running away from the
proper order of events, which in truth
it is natural for one of my profession
and time of life to do. Be it known to
you, my youthful readers that it is not
easy for an old doating Nun to transcribe
even a verse out of her Psalter, without
tacking to it at least a dozen of her own
childish observations.</p>

<p class='c018'>At Engelberg Amabel found the Nun
to whom Wolfenrad had directed her
to apply, and who was his confidante
and the secret instrument for effecting
the carrying away of Amalberga. She
assured Amabel, that her friend had by
no means been forced away; but that
on account of the assiduities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Lord of Landenberg, and the popular
disturbances which increased with every
day, Amalberga had voluntarily chosen
to withdraw herself from Engelberg.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Your partiality for the governor,”
said the artful hypocrite, “and
your incessant pleading in behalf of a
man whom she could not love, made
the Lady unwilling to let you know
her design. I was her sole confidante on
this occasion, and I think I have done
well in enabling the dear soul to escape
from the temptations of the wicked
world! She has taken refuge in the
Convent of Zurich, under the protection
of an old Lady called Urania, who is
either her friend or some near relation,
for I understand, never was there joy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>known equal to that of their meeting.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>In this account Amabel could not discover
the least vestige of deception or
improbability: still she blamed the Nun
greatly for concealing the real cause of
Amalberga’s disappearance, by which
means the spirit of discontent was encouraged
among the people against
Landenberg, who bore the odium of
having violated the sanctuary, and forcibly
carried away an inmate of those
holy walls.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Nun made but an indifferent defence
against this charge, and Amabel
left her by no means satisfied with her
conduct. However, she soon forgot
what little had displeased her in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Nun’s conversation, and gave herself up
entirely to the joy of being assured, that
one of her friends at least was safe in
the arms of friendship and of maternal
love.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! that I could but have the
same assurance respecting my beloved
Emmeline!” thus said Amabel to herself,
as she hastened back to her brother’s
cottage; “Oh! that as I pass
homewards, chance would but throw
Wolfenrad in my way, that I might
learn from him what he knows about
the dear-one! He might just tell me
in half a dozen words, and then hurry
away, in order that I might not blush
too deep a crimson, when the severe
Censurer of my actions looks me in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>face, and says with his magisterial air,—‘Now,
Amabel! whence do you
come, and with whom have you
spoken?’—How ridiculous, that Arnold
should take it into his head, that
an old man like Wolfenrad has designs
upon a young creature like me, not yet
twenty! Yet ridiculous as it is, his
anxiety proceeds from the warmth of
his affection for me, and I ought to forgive
my good Arnold for the faults of
his head, when I recollect the kindness
of his heart.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Such were the thoughts which occupied
Amabel, as she hastily retraced
the long way between her home and the
Convent; and as she past along, she
threw many an anxious look on every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>side in hopes of seeing the man, who
alone could confirm to her the fortunate
escape of her friend. Wolfenrad
had frequently business that carried him
to Engelberg, and it was by no means
improbable, that she should encounter
him on her way.</p>

<p class='c018'>In fact, the tempter had long been at
no great distance from the fair pilgrim,
though without her seeing him; since
he stole along concealed by a thick hawthorn
plantation, which bordered more
than half the road between the village
and the Convent of Engelberg.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is easy for the wicked to guess
what steps will be taken by unsuspecting
innocence, whose proceedings are
the natural result of existing circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and feelings. Wolfenrad knew
how warmly Amabel’s heart was interested
about her friends; he had given
her hopes of obtaining intelligence respecting
them; he had pointed out the
place, where a part of those hopes might
be realized; and he was therefore certain
of finding her on the road to that
place, before many days were elapsed.
He had accidentally missed seeing her
on her way to Engelberg; but when on
her return she was descending the Convent-hill,
he espied her from behind
the watch-tower which stands at the
farthest extremity of the mount, and
then hastened to shelter himself behind
the hawthorn hedge, in order that he
might unseen watch her motions, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>discover what temper she was in, before
he accosted her.</p>

<p class='c018'>And thus did he for some time steal
along, examining every change of her
expressive countenance, and drawing
but too just conclusions of the subject,
which employed her thoughts. Her
look, now gay, now sorrowful, and
the impatient glances which she frequently
threw around her, would have
been sufficient to betray her, even
though a few broken sentences, which
escaped from her in the anxiety of her
mind, had not left him without a doubt
of his presence being perfectly welcome.</p>

<p class='c018'>Wolfenrad’s plans for the innocent
girl’s ruin had been so long arranged,
that they were ready to be carried into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>effect at a moment’s warning; nor
could he have wished for a more favourable
opportunity than the present.
The fiercest passion for Amabel reigned
in his bosom, and deceived <i>him</i> who
was so well skilled in deceiving others.
He fancied, that in her impatient looks,
in the tone which she used in pronouncing
his name occasionally, there was
something more than mere friendship
for Emmeline, and that love was the
motive that made her so anxious to
meet him! Immortal powers! Love!
love from a girl, pure as innocence itself,
for such an earthly dæmon, a dæmon
both in person and in mind!</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Yet however she may be disposed,”
’twas thus he argued with himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span> “too abrupt an appearance, too
hasty a discovery of my views, might
do me a prejudice, and put her too much
upon her guard. When her impatience
is worked up to the highest pitch, I
shall be the more secure of her.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>And therefore he still remained invisible,
and hastened onwards, keeping
still a little way before her; so that
when the fair pilgrim reached the end
of the plantation, and emerged into the
open plain, she descried him crossing
the path at some distance, as if totally
unaware of her approach.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel gave a cry of joy, called him
by his name, and flew to join him.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Is it you, my fair dame?” answered
Wolfenrad. “What would you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>with me?”—and he stopped, as waiting
for her to come up to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! tell me! tell me! give me
some tidings of the damsel of Sargans!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“You have been to Engelberg, and
surely must have heard more there,
than I am able to tell you.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh! no, no, no! Emmeline!
speak of Emmeline!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Why, the Lady Emmeline....
Concealment being absolutely necessary....
But we are close to your jealous
brother’s house, and he may take offence
at our conference—Farewell! I
must find an opportunity of communicating
what I know unobserved, when
I return from Uri.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“From Uri? Heavens! and when
do you go thither, and how long shall
you remain away?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I set out to-morrow; as to my
stay, I fear the disturbances there will
make my return very distant.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel’s impatience to know something
decisive respecting her friend now
grew beyond all bounds. She entreated
him at least to put it out of doubt that
Emmeline had been saved from the flames,
and hesitated not to follow him into a
bye-path, which conducted to the Castle.
As they passed along, the deceiver began
a long and wonderful narrative of
Emmeline’s adventures, which occupied
his auditor’s whole attention; but as it
contained not one syllable of truth, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>would be superfluous to relate it
here.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“But one question more!” said
Amabel at length, and stopped. “See!
night is approaching; we are already
at the foot of the Castle-hill, and I have
still a weary way to traverse, ere I can
regain my brother’s cottage, where, I
fear, I must be already missed. You
assure me that Emmeline is safe, and is
concealed in the neighbourhood: Oh!
tell me then <i>where</i> she is concealed, for
my bosom pants to embrace her!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“That were easily done. You see
the Castle is close at hand: thither have
I brought her, and I mean to convey
her with me to Uri to-morrow, since
the disturbances  which prevail in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>these parts render them an unsafe
abode.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“To Uri? To-morrow? Cruel,
cruel Wolfenrad! Would you then
have removed her, without suffering me
to see her for one moment?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“How could I have contrived an
interview without betraying the secret?
Had not accident thrown you in my
way, I should not have had an opportunity
of even telling you, that she is
in your neighbourhood. However, as
soon as she was out of the reach of discovery,
you would have received a letter
explaining every thing. I left her
occupied in writing it, and when finished
it was to be delivered to your husband’s
care, who is now with her at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Castle, and who has been the chief
means of bringing her hither in safety.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What say you? My husband?
Is Edmund then with Emmeline? Oh!
lead me to him, dear Wolfenrad, I <i>must</i>
accompany you to the Castle; permit
me to pass this last evening with the dear
lady; or at least suffer me to embrace
her once more, and assure her of my
unchanged affection, and then my husband
can conduct me back to my brother.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Wolfenrad heard this proposal with a
malicious smile, and answered that for
<i>his</i> part he had no objection; but he
suggested his fears, lest her taking such
a step should displease the suspicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Arnold, who surpassed her husband in
jealousy a thousand fold.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! heed not that!” exclaimed
Amabel; “while I am with <i>you</i>, I can
set all suspicions at defiance!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>She said this thoughtlessly, for she
alluded to his age and ugliness. The
miscreant however interpreted it to his
own taste, and saw in it the confirmation
of his insolent hopes. He was on
the point of rewarding the avowal by a
tender pressure of her hand, which perhaps
might have opened her eyes, ere it
was too late: but she prevented him by
making a thousand fond enquiries respecting
her beloved Edmund, which
put him again upon his guard, and
which were not ended till they arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>at the Castle. The gates were closed:
Wolfenrad sounded his horn; the draw-bridge
descended. He entered the
Castle; Amabel followed him, and the
moment that she had passed the threshold,
heard with terror the noise of a
port-cullis falling behind her.</p>

<p class='c018'>How strange is it, that we should frequently
remain thoroughly blind till we
reach a certain point, and then be rouzed
at once from our delusions by some unimportant
circumstance! Amabel has
frequently told me since, that the sound
of that port-cullis (though nothing unusual
in the Castle) gave her the first
indistinct idea of her imprudence and
the danger of her situation.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her voice faltered, as she pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the names of Edmund and Emmeline,
while she hastily withdrew her hand,
which Wolfenrad had now seized with
an air of impetuous passion. She looked
him anxiously in the face, and her
eyes read with horror in his an expression,
which explained to her the whole
fearful secret.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet she was still unwilling to believe
that man so great a villain, whom she
had long believed so much her friend.
It was not till she was convinced, that
neither Edmund nor Emmeline were in
the Castle; that she found herself totally
alone with the wretch, whom she
had despised as being too insignificant
to be dangerous; and that an old woman,
whom (in order to calm the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>violence of her feelings) he had produced
to her as his wife, was nothing
more than a domestic; it was not till
then, that she saw the whole business
clearly, and the sight was one of such
danger, that perhaps had she been a
woman of a common mind, it would
have thrown her into such a state of
bodily insensibility, or of mental dejection,
as might effectually have prevented
all endeavours to effect an escape.
But Amabel was a daughter of
Helvetia! that is, she was a woman,
whose powers both of body and mind
existed in their fullest vigour; neither
the first was weakened by luxurious indulgence,
nor the second liable to be
subdued by imaginary terrors. In spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of all that credulity and imprudence
which had betrayed her into her present
danger, her imagination was still both
clear and acute enough to suggest a
means for effecting her rescue, or at
least for gaining time.</p>

<p class='c018'>She appeared reserved and shy, and
sat down in silence to the voluptuous
entertainment, which was now served
up by Wolfenrad’s confidante; the only
person, whom he suffered to penetrate
into that part of the Castle. Yet did
Amabel contrive to give her silence the
appearance of being preserved much
against her will; she refused not at
Wolfenrad’s request to lay aside the
large hat, which overshadowed her face,
and which (as he complained) concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>from him numberless beauties;
nor did she draw away very hastily or
with a look of extreme displeasure her
soft white hand, when he prest it passionately
between his own.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“May I flatter myself,” said the deceived
deceiver, “that Amabel does not
absolutely hate me?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“My religion forbids my hating
any one.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And you are not very much offended
at my having employed a little
artifice to procure myself the happiness
of this evening?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“—Artifice?—Nay; the effect of accident,
and ... and, I am afraid, my
own inclination was so much on your
side, that....”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>—“My charming Amabel! then I
may hope, that Wolfenrad is not entirely
indifferent to you!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Indifferent? Oh! that you are
not <i>indeed</i>!—And as to hoping ... why,
nobody can prevent your doing that,
you know.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>And with this kind of doubtful and
flattering discourse did she long entertain
the betrayer, and forgot not to fill
the silver bowls from time to time;
though the effects of his frequent
draughts prevented him from observing,
that while she poured wine into his
goblet, nothing but water entered into
her own.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the expence of a few disgusting
kisses, which were forced from her occasionally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>she at length had the pleasure
to see Wolfenrad fall senseless from
his chair. It was midnight; the old
woman had long since betaken herself
to rest, and Amabel found herself at liberty
to wander through the vacant
chambers in search of some means of
escape.</p>

<p class='c018'>Alas! the locks and bars were immoveable,
and no keys were to be
found.—She at length discovered an
unfastened door opening into a balcony;
it overhung the middle court; the
height was fearful; yet would she have
gladly ran the hazard of springing below,
if she had not dreaded the meeting
there with a greater danger, than
that from which she was flying. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Castle-Garrison occupied this quarter.
She heard from above the conversation,
which passed between the sentinels;
and its nature was such as to leave her
no hope of finding from them protection
or even pity. It also informed her, that
Wolfenrad’s bounty, and his winking at
their committing the most heinous offences,
had united them too closely to
his interests, to admit even a chance of
their acting in opposition to his will.</p>

<p class='c018'>She wept in agony! She wrung her
hands! At length despair took possession
of her whole soul. She eyed for
a while the torch, which flamed in her
hand, and in a moment of desperate resolution
she determined to set the Castle
on fire; in hopes of either being able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>effect her escape during the conflagration,
or at least of saving herself by
death from existing for one instant with
dishonour.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus resolved, she was on the point
of quitting the balcony when a well-known
name struck her ear. She stopt,
and listened. Two sentinels stood beneath
the balcony, and she heard one
tell the other, that it would be necessary
to wake Wolfenrad; for that he
(the sentinel) was just returned from
the outer wall, and had seen a company
of soldiers crossing over the plain; that
he had hailed one of them, and found
them to be part of those who had accompanied
Bloomberg to Sargans, and that
their leader with the rest of his troops
would follow them before mid-day.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>—“Bloomberg their leader?” said
his companion. “And since when has
the gentle peace-loving Bloomberg turned
soldier, and what has Wolfenrad to
fear from a fellow, who but yesterday
followed the plough?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Faith,” rejoined the first, “this is a
time, when every countryman exchanges
his sickle and ploughshare for a sword
and spear; and I know enough of Edmund
Bloomberg to be convinced, that
the carrying off his pretty wife will
make him rage like a mad bull.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Carrying off, d’ye call it?” said
the other; “I think, she seemed to follow
Wolfenrad of her own accord; and
if Bloomberg draws his sword upon her
account, the more fool Bloomberg!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>A burst of insulting laughter terminated
this conversation, every syllable
of which pierced Amabel to the heart;
and the soldiers separated, having agreed
that it was unnecessary to disturb Wolfenrad
that night, and that the news of
Bloomberg’s return might safely be delayed
till the next morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel burst into tears; but she soon
recollected, that she had better occupation
than weeping. A thousand ideas
floated before her mind, inspired by the
distant hope which she derived from the
assurance, that in a few hours her husband
would pass within sight of her
prison. The great object therefore was
to gain time to wait for his arrival with
safety, and find means to inform him of
her confinement in the Castle.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Accident furnished her with both.
She returned trembling into the apartment,
where the vile Wolfenrad still
lay sleeping, the most odious picture of
intoxication that the eye ever witnessed.
Despair made her snatch a knife from
the table, and she rushed to plunge it
into his heart; but here the softness of
woman’s nature got the better of her
resolution and her vengeance. She
threw down the knife, and hastened
into the balcony, that in the free air
and under the sky thick sown with
stars, she might implore the Creator of
that sky to look down upon and assist
her in this hour of fear and danger.
She rose from prayer much comforted:
she turned towards the East, and looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>eagerly for the arrival of the dawn,
whose approach was already announced.
She soon perceived, that the balcony in
which she stood, though much too high
from the ground to admit of her throwing
herself from it without being dashed
to pieces, at least commanded an extensive
view over the surrounding country,
and was admirably calculated for summoning
any passing travellers to her assistance.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! now, would but the sleeping Libertine
doze away the morning, all
might be well! Often did she steal
softly into the chamber to see, whether
he gave any signs of waking; again
the knife attracted her gaze. She seized
it, and concealed it in her bosom, as her
last resource should all others fail.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It was now broad-day. Wolfenrad
stretched himself, yawned, and opened
his red eye-lids. Amabel fled to a distant
corner, but his voice soon compelled
her to return.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“My charming angel,” said he,
“come near me. You filled my goblet
last night too generously, and this
morning I feel myself still under the influence
of the too potent liquor. Beshrew
me, but I am marvellously indisposed.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Let not that trouble you, my
dear friend,” answered Amabel, while
she advanced a few paces, trembling
with apprehension; “while I resided in
the Castle of Sargans, Count Donat frequently
found himself unwell from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>similar indulgence in convivial pleasures;
but he soon got the better of his
indisposition by using a warm bath,
which never failed to restore him to
perfect health within an hour. In the
next chamber there is a large brazen
cistern; the water shall be heated for
you without delay, and as soon as your
bath is ready, I will call some of your
attendants to convey you thither.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Without waiting for his answer, she
hastened to her new occupation; she
soon returned with one pitcher of water,
then went back again for another, and
thus contrived to get rid of near an
hour, never failing as she passed the
balcony to cast from it a glance of enquiry,
whether there were yet no signs
of her deliverer.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>It was in vain, that Wolfenrad desired
her to call some of the servants to
spare her this unnecessary labour.
Amabel remonstrated against the impropriety
of suffering herself to be seen by
strangers in his apartment, and at the
same time protested, that she felt the
greatest pleasure in taking this trouble,
since it was for <i>him</i> that she took it.
Wolfenrad knew not how to find terms
sufficiently strong to express his gratitude
for her attention, and protested,
that he had not flattered himself with
the idea of possessing so warm an interest
in her heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was still expatiating on the satisfaction
which this agreeable discovery
gave him, when the sound of trampling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>at a distance struck her hearing. She
looked towards the window, and descried
a cloud of dust. Down fell the
pitcher from her hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Your bath is ready!” she said in
a voice scarcely audible from agitation;
and while Wolfenrad staggered into the
adjoining chamber, she hastened into
the balcony. The horsemen came
nearer; she recognized many countenances
well known to her; she recognized
among them that of Edmund
Bloomberg.</p>

<p class='c018'>His name pronounced in her loudest
tone, the cry of “Help for the Virgin’s
sake!” and her handkerchief waved in
the air towards the horsemen, soon attracted
their attention.  With equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>surprise and terror Bloomberg recognized
his wife at a balcony of the Castle,
heard her implore assistance, and flew
with his brave companions to afford it.
What followed, I shall relate briefly:
the narrative of this adventure may appear
already too circumstantial, since
its connexion with the Sisters of Sargans
is not at present evident; but it
had too material an influence upon the
fate of all Helvetia to admit of my passing
it over with a slight mention.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before the Castle-Garrison had time
to communicate to their Superior that
intelligence, which they ought to have
conveyed to him the preceding night,
and while all hands were busily employed
in guarding against an attack on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>main-quarter, Bloomberg and his friends
had already forced their way into the
Castle at that neglected side, whence
Amabel had called to them for assistance.</p>

<p class='c018'>The bath, in which the still half-intoxicated
Wolfenrad hoped to get rid of
the effects of his night’s excess, was
crimsoned with his blood. Amabel again
found herself safe in the hands of her
husband, in whose bosom delight contended
with indignation. The opposition
of the garrison to the complete conquest
of the Castle was but trifling;
and this fortress would certainly have
remained in the hands of the Helvetians
(a circumstance to them of the greatest
advantage) had their numbers been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>strong enough to resist the troops, who
were shortly after sent against them by
the Abbot of St. Gall and other allies
of the governor. Bloomberg’s friends
were inadequate to maintaining the possession
of their conquest, and in a few
days afterwards he was compelled to
evacuate the Castle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hitherto, the resentment of the multitude
had been restrained within some
bounds: but Amabel’s adventure and
the death of Wolfenrad were the signal
for open rebellion. The whole country
was floated with blood: would that I
could say, that the blood which flowed
was entirely that of the foes of freedom!
But alas! the number of the oppressors
was too mighty. The Helvetians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>were over-powered; and after displaying
the sentiments and performing
the actions of heroes, Edmund Bloomberg,
Arnold Melthal, and his venerable
father Henric (to whom patriotism and
his daughter’s injuries had restored
some of his youthful strength) were
constrained to fly from those beloved
unhappy vallies, which once had been
the favourite abodes of freedom and
tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c018'>The name of “flight” was of itself
offensive to Helvetian candour and courage;
the place to which they were compelled
to address their flight, made it no
less painful than disgraceful. Altdorf,
which was in the jurisdiction of Gessler,
whose tyranny had already been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>cause of such bitter sufferings to Henric
and Arnold, was the only refuge which
remained to them. By remaining here
quiet and concealed, till time allowed
them to find fresh means of resisting
their enemies, they hoped to escape
Gessler’s notice; and accordingly they
hastened to take shelter at Altdorf, with
the brave William Tell, Bloomberg’s
half-brother: here also they were sure
of a powerful protector in the person of
Walter Forest, a man whose situation
and native greatness of mind struck
awe into the bosom even of the insolent
Gessler.</p>

<p class='c018'>Here then the fugitives remained
concealed, and nourished hopes of better
times, which perhaps would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>made even the present chearful, had
not domestic discord obtruded itself
into their little circle. The imprudence
with which Amabel had thrown herself
into the seducer’s snare, in spite of all
his warnings and remonstrances, had
not passed uncensured by her brother.
His bitter reproaches sometimes excited
Edmund’s anger, and sometimes his
jealousy; and the poor girl would have
been absolutely wretched, had not her
father sustained her cause, and had not
her innocence found a most strenuous
advocate in William Tell. It is true,
the language of veracity, in which she
related her unadorned story, was not
to be mistaken; but still it required
Tell’s cool unprejudiced nature, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>noble guileless heart, to see every circumstance
in its real colours.</p>

<p class='c018'>He at length succeeded in restoring
perfect harmony in Bloomberg’s family,
and Amabel blessed him for the second
time as the author of all her earthly happiness.
Perhaps, her entire reconciliation
with her husband was a little forwarded
by Arnold’s absence. This impetuous
young man had been the ring-leader
of those, who at the Easter
feast had insulted the Abbot of St. Gall
by singing the ballad of “Bishop Ulric;”
the Abbot had not forgotten it;
and the unfortunate Arnold at length
fell into one of the many snares, which
had been spread for him by his priestly
foe. Doubtless, he would have fallen a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>victim to the Abbot’s vengeance, had
not Werner Bernsdorf, by means which
it is unnecessary to relate circumstantially,
contrived to release him from his
dungeon, and sheltered him in his own
house.</p>

<p class='c018'>Though Amabel had received her
husband’s full pardon, still the reconciliation
had taken place too freshly to allow
her as yet to feel quite at her ease:
and now when the news arrived that
her brother (whom she loved most
dearly in spite of his violence) was a
prisoner, she would have had sufficient
reason to be unhappy, even had she not
been tormented by the most cruel anxiety
respecting the fate of the Damsels
of Sargans. She ceased not to make enquiries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>concerning them; and at length
she received the confirmation of her bitterest
apprehensions. Amalberga was
beyond a doubt totally in Landenberg’s
power, who (in spite of all Wolfenrad’s
assertions to the contrary) kept her
confined in the Castle of Rassburg; nor
was it less certain, that the Lady Emmeline
had perished in the flames of St.
Roswitha’s Sanctuary. Report spread
far and wide many strange anecdotes respecting
that conflagration, which I
shall relate in another place; in truth,
there is no one better able to give an
account of that dreadful incident than
myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>The tears, which Amabel shed for herself
and for her beloved friends, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>soon required by a still more painful
cause: misfortunes now awaited her,
which were worthy to be mourned with
tears of blood.</p>

<p class='c018'>The furious Gessler’s insolence increased
with every succeeding day.
His most earnest care was to discover
those who disapproved of him, that he
might revenge himself by their torments.
At length his pride and folly
grew to such a height, that he fixed the
plumed bonnet (which he usually wore)
upon a lance in the market-place of Altdorf,
and ordered, that all who passed
should bow before it. The sneering
populace obeyed, and contented themselves
with whispering to each other,
that they had much rather pay their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>respect to the empty hat, than the
wicked head which it was accustomed
to decorate: but William Tell and some
few others of the principal inhabitants
passed by the bonnet proudly and with
unbending necks. From that moment
did Gessler mark them down as the future
victims of his revenge and rancour.</p>

<p class='c018'>Had the tyrant dared to lay violent
hands on Tell, or had he contrived
means of stamping the mark of infamy
on his reputation; had he sold the wife
of his bosom for a slave, or murdered
his infants before his eyes; still would
all these atrocities have been excelled by
that, which now entered his infernal
brain. A prize was to be contended for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>by archers. The sport was interrupted
by the arrival of Gessler. What was
the horror of all who heard him, when
he commanded his guards to seize Tell’s
son, a lovely child but four years old,
and bind him to the tree which had been
selected as a mark for the arrows. He
then declared aloud with the most impious
execrations, that the heads of six
of Tell’s relations (whom he had confined
upon some slight pretences) should
fall before night, unless the father would
engage at a considerable distance to fix
a dart into an apple, which should be
placed on the head of the child.</p>

<p class='c018'>How did the father burn with secret
indignation, when Gessler dared to lay
before him this unnatural proposal!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>No earthly force could have compelled
him to arm his hand for the performance
of an action so uncertain and so
fearful; yet in fact the bow and arrow
could be scarcely called an uncertain
weapon in the hands of the most dexterous
archer in Helvetia: and after a
few moments past in thought he confidently
accepted a proposal, whose atrocity
(he was certain) was thoroughly
felt by all present; and whose consequence
he trusted would be the kindling
the fire of liberty in every bosom till it
should at length break into open flames,
and the emancipating his country for
ever from its present state of ignominious
bondage.</p>

<p class='c018'>A glance, more expressing contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>than wrath, was darted by Tell’s dark
eyes upon the Governor, as he rocked
himself backwards and forwards upon
his elevated chair of state, and looked
down upon the circle of noble Helvetians,
whom the sports had attracted to
Altdorf, as if they had been creatures of
an inferior kind.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gessler was too void of sensibility to
understand the meaning of the glance,
which was darted on him by Tell’s
piercing eye. He only smiled contemptuously
at having compelled the pride of
this great mind to stoop itself to his orders,
when he saw him press the lovely
laughing child, his latest-born, to his
heart with passion, and then bear him
in his arms to the tree, where he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>destined to take his stand. The apple,
which was the nominal mark for that
arrow, whose point Gessler hoped to
see crimsoned with human blood, was
fixed on the child’s head by the hands
of the unhappy father.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gessler’s attendants prepared to bind
the innocent creature to the tree; but
a spark of paternal spirit already burned
in the soul of the son.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I am an Helvetian!” cried he
with boyish eagerness; “I am not
afraid of death, but of bonds: why, if
my father <i>really</i> wanted to kill me, do
you think I would run away?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>All withdrew from the place, where
Death’s intended victim stood calm and
sweetly-smiling, like a second Isaac. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>multitude, agonized with terror, could
scarcely be heard to breathe: Tell had
already taken his station. All were still,
all dreading, lest the father’s hand, rendered
trembling and uncertain by anxiety
for his darling, should for the first
time miss the mark; when the arrow
whistled through the air, and fixed itself
in the apple just above the crown
of the child’s head, who saw it coming
towards him, and smiled as he marked
its flight.</p>

<p class='c018'>Now then all rushed, eagerly to learn
the event of this awful scene. Some exclaimed—“He
is fallen! he is fallen!”—But
the boy had only stooped to pick
up the apple which the force of the
blow had struck from his head; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>now presented it to his father, who
had flown to embrace his rescued darling
with speed scarce inferior to that of
his arrow.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I was certain, father,” cried the
child, as he hung round the neck of the
breathless Tell, “I was certain, that you
were not <i>really</i> going to kill your own
William!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Kill <i>thee</i>?” exclaimed the father;
“sooner would I have driven the arrow
into my own heart! But eternal curses
and sudden death to him, who would
have made a man the murderer of his
own child! Look!” he continued,
while he clasped the boy to his breast
with one hand, and with the other drew
from his bosom a dart, which he held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>towards Gessler, “Look, monster! had
the first arrow pierced my son’s breast,
<i>this</i> should have been buried to the very
beard in <i>thine</i>.—For this time thou art
safe; but yet rest thou assured, that at
the last thou shalt not escape unpunished!
Though <i>I</i> may spare thee, Heaven
will <i>not</i>.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Vengeance! vengeance! death
and curses to the tyrant! Eternal destruction
to the infernal Gessler and all
the miscreants who assist him!” thus
exclaimed the multitude with one voice;
while they closed round Tell in order to
conduct him home in safety, and protect
him from the Governor’s guards,
to whom a signal had been given to fall
upon him without delay.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>But the friends of liberty were too
weak in numbers to resist their powerful
oppressors. Before the gallant Tell
had retraced half the way to his cottage,
his companions were dispersed,
and himself delivered into the hands of
his enemy. Gessler commanded, that
he should be bound, thrown into a vessel
which was ready for sailing, and conveyed
to the dungeons of Kussnach, as
a violator of the respect due to imperial
dignity.</p>

<p class='c018'>No one was suffered to accompany
Tell; but his little son clung to the
bonds which were cutting the flesh of
his father, and cried, that he would
throw himself into the flood, if they
tore him from him. Gessler’s soldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>had no objection to taking two victims
instead of one, and yielded to the child’s
request, whom Amabel followed into
the vessel without being questioned.
The boy was her darling, and it was
she who had conducted him to the fatal
archery, where it was his destiny to
play so principal a part. The cry that
he was safe had rouzed her from the
swoon into which the sight of his danger
had thrown her; and she now
found it impossible to part so soon from
the cherub, whom she had expected
never more to clasp to her bosom but as
a corse. She had also no slight grounds
for apprehending new dangers for the
rescued victim, should she leave him in
the hands of his enemies with no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>protector than his captive father. Gessler’s
servile ministers could not have
well pitched upon a more skilful or certain
means of inflicting pain on Tell,
than by murdering his son before his
face.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel was aware of this; and dreading
lest this horrible plan of vengeance
should occur to the soldiers, she took
the first opportunity of enticing the
child away from his father, and concealing
him in a dark corner of the vessel.
Here she charged the little William
to remain quiet, and pointing to
Tell, bade him observe how quiet his
father was lying on the floor, his fettered
hands clasped together and raised towards
Heaven, whither his eyes directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>devout and imploring glances, which
reached the Preserver of innocence
above the clouds.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What is my father doing?” enquired
the child at length in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“He is praying for himself and for
us,” answered Amabel.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! then God will hear him,
and help him; and then you know, we
can creep out, and take away those ugly
cords from his poor bleeding hands.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel replied in the manner, which
she thought most likely to satisfy the
child; and a conversation was carried
on in whispers between her and her
little companion which gradually became
interesting enough to prevent their observing
that a dreadful storm was rising,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that thick clouds had changed the day
into night, and that the light vessel
was forced far out of its intended
course. The rolling of the thunder,
the frequent flashes of lightning, and
the heavy torrents of rain at length
made both attentive and silent; till
William proposed that he should steal
to his father under covert of the thick
darkness, and spread his little coat over
him, for Tell lay entirely exposed to the
tempest. Amabel burst into tears as
she listened to the kind-hearted boy,
then gave him her own cloak, and bade
him hasten to alleviate the prisoner’s
sufferings.</p>

<p class='c018'>But Tell showed by no sign, that he
was conscious of this affecting testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of his child’s care: he remained with
his hands clasped, and his eyes still fixed
upon the heavens. Perhaps, the transactions
of that day had blunted all his
feelings; perhaps, he was revolving
plans of escape, which never fail to occupy
the thoughts of the captive hero,
and whose future execution frequently
prevent his being sensible of the weight
of present calamities.</p>

<p class='c018'>The tempest continued to rage: with
every moment the danger of the slight
vessel became more imminent. Tell,
Amabel, and the child were now left by
themselves. The other persons were
employed in various quarters, endeavouring
if possible to save the ship,
which was already deprived of sail and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>mast. The prisoners were now the happiest
of the party: they at least rejoiced
in the hope of perishing together. The
child too, who had no clear idea of the
danger, and fancied that everything
went wrong only because his father was
in bonds, ceased not to exert all his
little powers in endeavouring to untye
the cords; but even with Amabel’s assistance
he found the task too difficult
for his strength.</p>

<p class='c018'>While they were still employed in
this unavailing labour, they heard the
cry of distress increase with tenfold violence:
presently some one on the upper
deck exclaimed—“Now then all is lost!
What winds and waves have failed in
doing, will be done by the hidden rocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>which abound upon this coast, and with
which not a soul of us is acquainted.
Oh! what would I now give to be as
good a pilot as Tell, and to possess his
knowledge of these shores!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel started up, and listened with
more attention. She heard the name
of Tell frequently mentioned; and after
a few minutes past in contention, some
of the sailors approached the place,
where she stood by the side of her unfortunate
friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Tell,” said the Captain, “you
know, that your life is forfeit to the
law; but if you will engage to conduct
the vessel safe to land, as a favour we
will unbind you, and promise to do our
utmost to obtain a milder sentence for
you from the Emperor’s mercy.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>—“I have saved many a vessel,” answered
Tell, “in a more desperate situation
than the present; and that which
has succeeded with me ten times before,
I trust, will not fail with me now.—As
to what you say about favours, bestow
them on those who ask them; I expect
mercy from no one, save from Him
under whose hand we all now tremble!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell was unbound, and the rudder
committed to his care. William and
Amabel still remained close by his side,
while the rest of the ship’s company dispersed
to their several stations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell’s rudder seemed to command the
tempest: he steered confidently through
the foaming waves, and already the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>companions of his danger shouted with
joy at the certainty of their escape.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And what will be the reward of
our preserver?” asked one of the most
compassionate among Gessler’s soldiers.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What <i>should</i> it be?” answered
their leader angrily. “The most he
can lay claim to is a speedy death without
being previously tortured; or perhaps
his sentence may be softened into
that of eternal imprisonment.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell was silent, and cast a despairing
look through the dark clouds of the
storm towards the Only-one, from
whom he had hopes of assistance!</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! that I had no one here to
tremble for, except myself!” said Tell
to the afflicted Amabel, who knelt beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>him after a silence of some minutes—“how
quickly should I be safe from the
malice of my enemies!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And what then would you
do?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“The rocks are not lofty! One
bold and lucky spring, and I were in
safety!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Throw me into the waves, father!”
cried the boy, “throw me into
the waves, for <i>I</i> am a hindrance to
you!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>At that moment a tremendous flash
of lightning illuminated the whole
scene. Tell descried an immense tree at
a slight distance growing out of a rock
which they were approaching, and extending
its arms far over the foaming
flood—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Amabel!” cried Tell, “dare you
seize a bough of that tree as we pass
under it, suffer the bark to be carried
away from you, and cling fast to the
branch, till I have time to come to your
assistance?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I dare! I dare!” cried Amabel
in the tone of desperation—“But the
child! Oh! God! the child!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Be that my care!—Be prepared!—Now
then!” he cried, and was
obeyed. He saw that she had fast hold
of the bough, and in the same moment
he seized the boy with his left arm,
with his right turned the rudder to-wards
the rock, then sprang boldly
from the deck, and left the vessel with
its unthankful freight a prey to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>raging flood. The tempest seized it;
the rudder was broken in the shock,
and dreadful was the shriek of the
crew, as the fury of the winds and
waves drove it far away over the roaring
billows. Tell sprang upon the rock
unhurt; he hastily climbed up the upper
part of the coast, and having placed the
boy on the ground, he flew to give
Amabel his assistance. But she, who
was deficient neither in strength of body
or presence of mind, had already found
means to gain the rock in which the
tree was rooted, had forced her way
through all impediments, and had nearly
reached the loftiest of the broken
cliffs, before he could arrive. He assisted
her to attain the summit, when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>instantly sank on her knees, and returned
thanks to God with all the joy of one
just rescued from destruction.</p>

<p class='c018'>But I forget, that Tell and Amabel
are in fact foreign to my story, and I
have already suffered myself to dwell
on their adventures too long, to the
prejudice of my real heroines. I will
therefore pass over in silence the circumstances
which followed their escape
from the vessel, and those which again
threw them into Gessler’s power. Suffice
it to say, that the dart which the
Avenger of human nature seemed to
have reserved for that express purpose,
the dart which Tell had shown Gessler,
in the first burst of his indignation, that
very dart pierced the tyrant’s bosom;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and thus was Helvetia freed from a
monster, who had laid waste her tranquil
vallies with circumstances of much
greater cruelty, than were ever attributed
to fabled dragons in the Legends
of Romance.</p>

<p class='c018'>After performing this dangerous act
of justice, Tell betook himself to Stein,
where he intended to take refuge with
Werner Bernsdorf. Here he found new
cause to rejoice at having rid the world
of Gessler. Bernsdorf’s new-raised edifice,
the admiration of the whole country,
lay an heap of ashes! Gessler had
thought it too good for a private man,
and had threatened to pull it down.
Werner laughed at his threats, for it
seemed to be no trifle to destroy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>property of a man of his consequence,
while living in the midst of a neighbourhood,
where every arm and every heart
were devoted to his service: but he did
not reflect, that villany can find a hundred
secret means for effecting its purposes.
In the depth of the night a fire
broke out, which, from its bursting all
at once from the four corners of the
building, and at a time when all were
buried in sleep, gained ground too rapidly
to admit of its being got under.
Werner and Gertrude saved nothing
from the flames, except their lives.
Every one exclaimed against secret incendiaries,
and no one doubted by whose
orders this shameful action had been
committed: in fact, there were proofs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>sufficient to make it morally certain,
that the author of this mischief could
be no other than Gessler.</p>

<p class='c018'>The sight of his friend’s distress (for
this fire had reduced Werner to beggary)
raised Tell’s indignation to the
highest pitch. He left Amabel and his
son to the care of Gertrude, and hastened
with Bernsdorf in disguise back
to Altdorf, to consult with Walter Forest
and Henric Melthal on the best and
speediest means of rescuing Helvetia
from her disgraceful yoke.  Arnold
Melthal also, who had but lately escaped
from the dungeons of the Abbot of St.
Gall, increased their band; and the
union of five men so remarkable for
courage and for prudence produced such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>fortunate and such glorious consequences,
as will immortalize their
names to the latest posterity<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bernsdorf’s real name was Staufacher.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Bloomberg hastened to Stein, to rejoice
with his wife at her escape, and to
efface in her embraces the injurious impressions,
to which his too easy heart
had given way during their separation.
Spite and Envy had not neglected the
opportunity of calumniating one of
Amabel’s noblest actions. Her frank
and guileless nature had prevented her
from making it a secret, that the admirable
William Tell had been the first
love of her innocent heart; and her voluntary
forsaking her family, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that she might share the fate of that gallant
prisoner (a circumstance of which
all Altdorf had been an eye-witness) had
found that misinterpretation, which Calumny
is always so eager to bestow on
those heroic actions, of which she feels
herself incapable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fortunately the heart of Edmund
Bloomberg was not more prone to
jealous doubts, than open to conviction.
Nothing more than the sight of his excellent
brother, and the relation of the
true circumstances of the case, was necessary
to make him feel the folly of
suspecting the integrity of such a man.
He requested his lovely wife to forgive
his unjust suspicions; and the temporary
separation of their hearts seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to have renewed his former love with
such violence, that he could not resolve
to tear himself away from her, in spite
of his earnest desire to participate with
his friends in the glorious attempt to
rescue Helvetia from her chains.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet was not Edmund entirely idle.
His wife’s anxiety respecting the Damsels
of Sargans had formerly induced
him to make enquiries respecting their
fate; but Wolfenrad (whose sole view
was to remove the husband, in order
that the unprotected wife might fall a
prey during his absence) had taken care
to direct his search, where he well
knew that it must be fruitless. Edmund
at length discovered the trick, and incensed
at having been sent on such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>wild-goose-chase, he hastened back accompanied
by a band of well-armed
companions, determined to revenge the
insult. His vengeance was complete,
and now at Amabel’s request he again
resumed his search after the Damsels of
Sargans: nor was it long before he ascertained,
that report had said no more
than the truth, when she asserted that
Amalberga was a captive in the dungeons
of Rassburg, and that Emmeline
had really perished among the flames.
To rescue the one and to revenge the
other now formed the only subject of
the conversations, which passed between
Gertrude, Amabel, and her husband.</p>

<p class='c018'>The more they discussed the circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the more dreadful did the fate
of the two sisters appear, and the more
difficult of execution did they find their
plans respecting them. They were conscious,
that without some powerful
supporter, their strength was insufficient
for the undertaking; and Amabel’s
thoughts immediately suggested to
her the names of two young knights, to
whom at a former period the Damsels of
Sargans had been by no means indifferent,
and who (she doubted not)
would still feel so much interest about
them, as to forward her wish to avenge
the death of the one and procure the deliverance
of the other.</p>

<p class='c018'>On enquiry, it appeared, that but few
hopes could be grounded upon the aid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of Count Herman of Werdenberg.
Suspicions, injurious to Emmeline’s character,
had made him resolve to conquer
his passion for her: but to eradicate
her from his heart had not been
found a task so easy, as he imagined;
and at length he had quitted Germany,
tormented by his unsatisfied love, and
by anger at himself for not having succeeded
in overcoming it. He was at
this time in England, whence his relations
had solicited his return most earnestly,
but in vain.</p>

<p class='c018'>But little as was to be expected from
Count Herman, so much the more was
to be hoped from the noble Eginhart of
Torrenburg, and it was resolved that
Edmund should hasten to him without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>delay: it was not long before he returned
accompanied by the youthful hero.</p>

<p class='c018'>There are reasons, which it is unnecessary
to disclose, which make it particularly
painful to me to trace the name
of Torrenburg, and to recollect how
closely his fate is interwoven with that
of Amalberga of Sargans: but it must
be done, and I will not complain. Yes,
there ought to be now no sacrifice too
difficult for my heart to make: there
<i>shall</i> be none!</p>

<p class='c018'>Eginhart of Torrenburg, who had
formerly been as closely bound to Helen
of Homburg through motives of policy,
as he was now attached by affection and
his own choice to the lovely Amalberga,
was at length free from his engagements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to the former, and at liberty to bestow
his hand according to the dictates of his
heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen (alas for that poor Helen!) had
been carried off on her bridal-day by
that fierce terrific tyrant, Donat, Count
of Carlsheim and Sargans: force had
compelled her to become his wife! Angels
of innocence, where were you then
lingering, that you gave the unfortunate
no warning-sign of the danger, into
which she was on the brink of falling?
Yet scarcely can I decide, which would
have been the harder fate; to become
the victim of Count Donat, or with a
heart glowing with love to be delivered
into the arms of a husband, whose soul
was in secret devoted to another, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>whose hand was only given to the
wretched Helen from motives of honour
and respect for his plighted word.</p>

<p class='c018'>Instead of the expected bride, the
news of her being carried off reached
the Castle of Torrenburg, where the
wedding was to have been celebrated.
Though love had no share in
his concern on this occasion, compassion
for the unfortunate girl, and the
insult thus offered to himself, made the
young Count immediately place himself
at the head of his vassals, and hasten to
rescue the intended victim from Donat’s
clutches.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen, who had been compelled to
assent to this unhallowed union at the
Castle of Upper Halbstein, was now ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>to follow her unamiable Lord
to another of his fortresses situated
southwards among the Rhœtian Alps.
She received the command with joy,
for at the Castle of Sargans she hoped
at least to receive the consolations of
friendship. Her step-daughters had
been the play-fellows of Helen’s childhood
during several weeks; and since
their separation occasional letters and
messages conveyed by third persons had
frequently assured her, that she still
lived in the remembrances of her early
friends. In their embraces she hoped
to find some alleviation of her sufferings:
she flattered herself also, that the
station which she was now to fill in their
house, would give her frequent opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of making the situation of the
poor girls more happy than it had been
hitherto; and this reflexion prevented
her from feeling herself quite miserable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cruel fate decreed, that her journey,
which was made in company with her
husband and under the protection of a
numerous retinue, should be interrupted
by the arrival of the Count of Torrenburg
and his forces. It was now, that for the
first time she saw the bridegroom, whom
fortune had destined never to be hers;
for whose character she had ever been
taught to entertain the highest admiration;
and whose sight (for oh! there
never yet was man more formed to captivate
the soul of woman) was sufficient
to make her feel, how near her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>happiness had been, and how completely
it was now lost to her for ever.</p>

<p class='c018'>Torrenburg’s valour forced Count
Donat to seek his safety in flight, and
the trembling Helen was brought before
the conqueror. Helen (who believed
herself to be no less dear to her destined
bridegroom, than He was dear to
Her) for a few moments forgot her duty;
but melancholy reflexion soon made her
tear herself away from the embraces of
the beloved warrior, and she commanded
him to leave her.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“My rescue comes too late!” she
exclaimed, wringing her hands in agony;
“I am Count Donat’s wife, and
must remain so, though it should break
my heart! Oh! Eginhart, restore me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to my husband, and forget the unfortunate,
whom fate has separated from
you for ever.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Tears stood glittering in the warrior’s
eyes. He advanced, as if he would
have detained her, but she peremptorily
forbade his nearer approach. She hastened
to her palfrey, and giving the reins
to the animal, she soon reached the valley,
whither Donat and his vassals had
directed their flight.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen’s conduct on this occasion,
which might well have been termed a
difficult effort, if virtue and duty did
not make every effort easy, was rewarded
by her stern husband with coldness,
with sarcasms, with reproaches.
She arrived at Sargans; and here was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Helen destined to find the disappointment
of her last poor promised pleasure,
the society of her two friends.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Donat held out to her as a
mark of his complaisance and of his
consideration for her happiness, that he
had ordered the only one of his daughters
who remained to him (for the
other had unaccountably disappeared)
to quit the Castle. In vain did Helen
implore him to recall Emmeline of Sargans
from the Sanctuary of St. Roswitha:
he was deaf to her entreaties, and
she was left a prey to solitude and despair.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor had the husband, who had
gained her hand by such unworthy
means, reason to be entirely satisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>with his situation. The Counts of Torrenburg,
Mayenfield, and Homburg,
mortally offended at the carrying off of
Helen, like a deluge over-ran with their
forces the territories of Count Donat.
His fortresses were forced and plundered
one after another, and they now advanced
to attack the Castle of Sargans.
But Helen, whose only remaining consolation
was derived from the most punctilious
discharge of her duties, came forth
to throw herself at the feet of her relations;
and she implored for peace so fervently
and so earnestly, and she asserted
with so much solemnity her belief,
that being once become the Count of
Carlsheim’s wife, it was her duty to
live and die with him, (a duty, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>she was resolved to fulfill, whatever
might be the consequences,) that her
intercession was found irresistible.
Dearly was Helen beloved by her parents;
earnestly did they desire her
happiness, which they well knew she
never could find in the arms of Donat:
but it was by themselves, that she had been
taught the merit of sacrificing all other
considerations to that of fulfilling her
duties; how then could they advise her
now to break through the rules, which
they had themselves laid down for her?—Peace
was granted, and granted solely
to Helen’s intercession. The ravisher
was left in possession of his unwilling
bride; and her relations quitted
his territories, having first exacted from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>him the most solemn and dreadful oath
to recompense her for the happy station,
of which he had deprived her, by unchanging
love and never-ceasing anxiety
for her welfare.</p>

<p class='c018'>Donat took the oath: how he kept
it, is a secret to all save the Almighty
and Helen: but she has sworn in the
presence of God to be silent on this subject,
and she will carry that dreadful secret
with her to the grave unpublished.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was very—oh! <i>very</i> miserable!
On those days only, when her
stern husband was from home, had she
any gleams of sunshine. On one of
these days an unknown messenger arrived,
and desired to speak with the
Lady Emmeline of Sargans. He was informed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that she was not at the Castle,
and he was conducted to Helen. He
brought letters from the Lake of Thun,
which he at length confided to her,
though unwillingly, and only (as he
said) induced by the frank expression
of her countenance.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“But,” said he, “will you deliver
them to the Lady Emmeline with your
own hands?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen, who lived at Sargans almost
in a state of captivity, knew too well
that she was not authorised to give such
a promise, and only answered by a melancholy
shake of the head. Her look,
the suspicious countenances of the attendants,
and the well-known character
of her husband, alarmed the messenger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and made him suspect that his
life was in danger: he stole unperceived
to the gate, and hastened away. The
packet was thus left in Helen’s possession.
She knew, that it would be impossible
to deliver it into the hands of
her, for whom it was intended; she
long sought for opportunities of doing
so in vain; and at length ennui, and
her anxiety to obtain some further information
respecting the Sisters, which
might possibly furnish her with the
means of alleviating their cruel destiny,
induced her to open the letters.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were from Amabel Melthal and
the lost Amalberga. Heavens! what
unexpected discoveries did Helen make
while perusing them;  discoveries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>which had no slight connexion with her
own situation! God be thanked, that
among other things they made it known
to her, that nothing but duty to his parents,
and consideration for his plighted
word, had induced Eginhart of Torrenburg
to offer her his hand, while
every fond sentiment of his heart had
long been Amalberga’s. This discovery
at first wounded her to the very soul;
but after a time she drew from it reasons
for being better satisfied with her
fate, and she resolutely banished the
beloved youth from her memory, in
which till then he had too frequently
occupied a place.</p>

<p class='c018'>Determined to abstract herself entirely
from every thing which regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>herself, Helen now determined to consider
the happiness of her two friends as
her only object in life. She endeavoured
to make herself mistress of every circumstance
belonging to them. Mention
was made in one of Amabel’s letters
of an old maid-servant at Sargans, called
Bertha, who had been Emmeline’s confidante
during the latter days of her
abode at her father’s mansion; and in
hopes of gaining some further information
Helen desired, that Bertha might be
brought before her. She was answered,
that the old woman had been sick for
several weeks, and was now drawing
near her end. To the great astonishment
of the domestics Helen immediately
hastened to Bertha’s chamber, saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>that she would go and comfort her
in her last moments.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen had but little time allowed her
to perform this charitable office: yet
that little she employed to the best advantage,
and in return Bertha’s gratitude
rewarded her more amply, than
she had hoped. Bertha, who had fallen
ill soon after Emmeline’s departure,
had only had time to forward the letter
for Amabel; another packet, intended
for the Countess Urania Venosta, was
still in her possession. She gave it to
Helen, and implored her to take care,
that it reached its destination. That
was not in Helen’s power; she kept it
for some time, in constant terror lest
her tyrant husband should discover it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and lest it should be the means of
drawing down on herself and Emmeline
fresh anger and increased sufferings.
At length, she resolved at least to put
the contents out of Count Donat’s
power to bury in oblivion: she broke
the seal, and what she read exalted her
impatience to rescue the unfortunate
writer to a degree, that was almost too
strong to admit of concealment.</p>

<p class='c018'>What Helen suffered at this period is
not to be expressed; perhaps her own
misfortunes had made her still more
compassionate towards those of others,
than it was her nature otherwise to be.
Three objects were now never out of
her thoughts for a moment. The first
was, since the Count of Torrenburg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>was now lost to her for ever, to make
known to him the present residence of
Amalberga; but how to convey to him
that intelligence, she in vain sought to
discover. The second was, if possible,
to rescue Emmeline from the detested
Convent of St. Roswitha; but alas!
she had but little hopes of delivering
others, while she was herself a captive
in the Castle of Sargans. The last was,
to obtain possession of the key to that
chamber, in which was the secret entrance
to the subterraneous passages
leading to the dwellings of the Anchorets.</p>

<p class='c018'>The last seemed to afford her the
most probable means of gratifying her
two former wishes; perhaps too, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>was unconsciously desirous of securing
a means of escaping from the Castle,
should she ever find such a step necessary.
It is at least certain, that in her
eagerness to carry her point, she took
many steps, which prudence would not
justify. Frequently did she repair to
that chamber; she found the door
guarded by seven locks. Frequently in
the dead of the night, when all slept, or
seemed to sleep, did she try the house-keys,
which were in her charge; and
when at length two of the locks shot
back from their fastenings, she sank on
her knees, and thanked Heaven with a
flood of tears. She doubted not, that
the rest of the locks would yield to her
perseverance; but a sudden noise at no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>great distance prevented her from pushing
the attempt farther that night, and
she hastened back to her chamber with
a heart filled with delight and expectation.</p>

<p class='c018'>Joy, at being so near the accomplishment
of her wishes, prevented her from
sleeping during the remainder of the
night, and she employed the vacant
hours in revolving her future plans.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“If,” said she to herself, after
giving the matter her most serious consideration;
“if I should be so fortunate
as to obtain an entrance into the mysterious
chamber to-morrow night, I will
hasten to the subterraneous passage
without losing a moment. A torch,
and the clear description of the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>given in Amalberga’s letter will guide
me to the Hermitage to a certainty,
and I need only use more than ordinary
diligence, in order to be back at the
Castle before day-break; for precious as
liberty appears to me, I will not obtain
it by improper means. I am Donat’s
wife, and privately to withdraw myself
from his protection were to commit an
act of infidelity and treason against my
husband. I will content myself therefore
with relating what I know to the
good hermits, and entreating them to
take the best and speediest means of rescuing
Emmeline from her dangerous
abode, and for placing the fortunate
Amalberga in the arms of Torrenburg!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>On second thoughts, she reflected,
that merely to give this intelligence to
the hermits would not be to do
enough; it would also be necessary to
give some explanation to the Countess
Urania respecting the letters which she
had opened, and by advising Torrenburg
to make Amalberga his wife, to
render it clear to him, that she had herself
forgotten the tyes which once existed
between them. Perhaps too, a
threatening letter to the Abbot of Curwald
(should all other means fail)
might have some weight in inducing
him to surrender Emmeline. In order
that nothing might delay her on the ensuing
night, she rose instantly from
her bed, and began to write. But before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>her letters were concluded, it was
morning, and her attendants, or rather
her jailors, entered the apartment to
wake her. They exprest no little surprise
at finding her already out of
bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I presume, noble Lady,” said
the eldest of them, “either some joyous
foreboding, or some prophetic
dream has roused you from your couch
so early. Our Lord will return to-day;
in truth, we knew this yesterday, but
we kept it to make our morning-greeting
the more welcome, and also through
apprehension lest your joy at this intelligence
should spoil your night’s rest.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen only answered the speaker by
one of those expressive glances, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>which the open-hearted repay words,
which belie the secret mind. She was well
aware, that her women who had been
so often the witnesses of her sufferings,
could not but know the nature of those
feelings, which Donat’s return was
likely to excite in her bosom. Nor did
she alone tremble in the presence of the
fierce Count of Carlsheim; every creature
that existed in the Castle listened
to his name with terror, and nothing
but irony had dictated this speech of the
insolent Jutta. Yet dared not Helen
find the least fault with any one of her
female attendants, who were chiefly composed
of her husband’s former favourites,
and the meanest of whom had
more influence with him still, than was
allowed to his unhappy wife.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The news of Donat’s return was soon
confirmed: it was scarcely mid-day,
when she heard the drawbridge resounding
beneath the hasty trampling
of his black steed. She hastened to receive
him at the gate with that smile of
submissive duty, which she had accustomed
herself always to wear in his presence.
He repulsed her offered hand
with a furious look, and shut himself
up in his own chamber with such of his
dependents, as were most in his confidence.
An hour elapsed; his chamber-door
was thrown open, and Donat
rushed out again, to all appearance
more incensed, if possible, than before.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Arm! arm!” cried he with
a voice of thunder, which resounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>through the whole fortress, and
which soon collected all his soldiers
around him, who, wearied with the
journey from which they were just returned,
were better fitted for repose
than for a second expedition; “to
horse, and away this instant; business
of importance summons us, and which
admits of no delay. Talk not of weariness,
or exhausted strength! the deed,
which now demands your faulchions,
could be executed, if your arms were half
useless; for I lead you not against stout
warriors, but cowardly monks, on
whom I swear to be revenged before
sun-set!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>They were too well accustomed to
obey Count Donat at the first motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of his finger, to make any remonstrances.
In a few minutes all were
mounted, and their horses galloped over
the echoing draw-bridge into the valley
below, whence they disappeared from
the eyes of those, who gazed after them,
with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Castle-inhabitants looked on
each other in silent astonishment.
The similarity of their present feelings
produced a kind of confidence
between the Countess and her women;
and one of them confessed to her, her
being almost certain, that she knew the
cause of all this uproar. She would
however only impart thus much of her
knowledge: on his return homewards
the Count had received a letter from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>one who was in the habit of sending
him intelligence, and this letter most
probably contained the spark, which
had kindled such flames in the bosom
of Count Donat; for as soon as he had
read it to his confidents, he tore it in a
thousand pieces, and trampled it under
his feet. Besides this, in the midst of
a torrent of execrations he had been
heard to mention the Abbot of Curwald
and his daughter Emmeline.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Emmeline and the Abbot?” exclaimed
Helen delighted. “Is it possible,
that some benevolent Being should
have opened his eyes to the miseries of
his daughter? Is it to rescue her, that
he departed in such haste? Ah! then
why have I so long delayed to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>nearest and surest way for effecting her
deliverance? Had I but confest her
danger to Count Donat.... Surely the
worst of men could not endure, that
his child should be overwhelmed in
shame and ruin! The depravity of the
Nuns of St. Roswitha must have been
concealed from Count Donat, or he
never would have made his daughter a
member of their society!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>These reflections, which were only
half pronounced by Helen, were totally
unintelligible to her attendants, who
continued to discuss what had past, and
to conjecture what was to follow; this
occupied them so entirely, that they
did not perceive, that their mistress had
left them. She had hastened to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>husband’s chamber, where she hoped
to obtain some insight into the circumstance,
which at once both rejoiced and
alarmed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fragments of the important letter
still lay upon the floor; she eagerly
seized them, and having secured herself
against interruption, put them
again together carefully. She learned
from them the truth of what she had
just been told; the writer warned
Count Donat to beware of the Abbot’s
artifices; discovered to him, that St.
Roswitha’s Sanctuary was little better
than the harem of the Monks of Curwald;
and that by enclosing the Lady
Emmeline within these sacrilegious
walls, he had delivered up his daughter
to the passion of her licentious lover.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>No wonder, that information like
this should have given a deadly wound
to Count Donat’s pride: nor (in spite
of his own excesses) was he so totally
lost to shame as to endure patiently,
that his daughter should become the
prey of a libertine. He was almost
frantic with rage, and for the first time
in his life he drew his sword to punish
the insulters of virtue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen sank on her knees, and thanked
God for this unexpected accomplishment
of her wishes. She sent a thousand
prayers after her husband for the
good success of his expedition: she
even went so far, as to begin to make
preparations for receiving the rescued
Emmeline, whom in fancy she already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>prest to her heart; and when this
agreeable occupation was finished, she
turned her thoughts towards guessing
at the benevolent writer of the letter,
which had induced the father to hasten
to preserve his child.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor simple Helen! it entered not
into her thoughts (and it was not till
long after, that she made the discovery)
that villainy often performs a seemingly
virtuous action, in order to forward its
own unholy designs. She knew not,
that the author of that letter was Wolfenrad.
It seems, that those oppressors
of Rhœtian and Helvetian liberty, the
lord governors and their assistants, carried
on a very close though secret understanding
with some of the most potent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>noblemen, whose object it was
equally to bring the inhabitants of these
unfortunate countries still more beneath
the yoke, and to build upon their subjection
the fabric of their own power
and grandeur. Among the secret allies
of Gessler and Landenberg, Count
Donat and the Abbot of Curwald were
the most distinguished; and Wolfenrad
on account of his well-known skill
in penmanship was frequently employed
by both the governors to carry on their
correspondence both with Curwald and
Sargans.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still the fact was, that neither of
these parties meant honestly to each
other. Donat and the Abbot were determined
only to go hand in hand with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the vice-regents so long, as it suited
their own views; and <i>these</i> on the other
side intended, as soon as they had derived
as much benefit as they could
from the assistance of the Count and his
ecclesiastical ally, to excite a quarrel between
them, and then join with the
one in plundering the other.</p>

<p class='c018'>We have already seen, how imprudently
Amabel had laid her secrets open
to Wolfenrad. Her letters to Emmeline
passed through his hands, and he
missed not this opportunity to increase
his knowledge of the affairs of the Count
of Carlsheim; and though Emmeline’s
letters to Amabel were not <i>confided</i> to
him, by one artifice or another he had
not failed to obtain a sight of them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Bloomberg’s simple wife observed indeed,
that the seal of Emmeline’s
packet had been forced; but she little
guest by whom.</p>

<p class='c018'>The contents of this letter immediately
furnished him with the most certain
means for producing an irreconcileable
hatred between Count Donat and
the potent Abbot of Curwald. The
power of the latter was beginning to
appear dangerous to the Lord Governors;
but they could expect nothing but
an accession of strength to themselves,
while the Count of Carlsheim and the
Abbot were mutually weakening themselves
in feudal skirmishes. Such was
Wolfenrad’s object in writing this warning-letter,
whose author was loaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>with blessings by the unsuspicious Helen,
while waiting with a throbbing
heart for the return of her Lord.</p>

<p class='c018'>The night arrived. She now thought
no longer of attempting to open the
door of the mysterious chamber, which
she had meant to attempt at this hour,
since a principal object of her wish to
visit the Hermitage was already accomplished.
Besides, the design could not
then have been possibly executed, since
every one in the Castle was still awake,
and waiting with impatience for Count
Donat’s return.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was almost morning, when some
of her attendants rushed with looks of
terror into Helen’s apartment, and entreated
her to ascend the upper platform,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>whence she would discern towards
the west indubitable marks of
some dreadful conflagration.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“God preserve us from some mishap!”
exclaimed Helen, while she followed
her women to the battlements;
the whole quarter of the heavens towards
Curwald seemed one blaze of
red!—“Oh! Donat, Donat, what hast
thou done? Were there no gentler
means?—Emmeline, my poor Emmeline,
where art thou at this moment?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen’s fears were but too well-founded.
Donat, in doing what he
thought it right to do, had done it in
his usual manner. Wolfenrad’s letter
had given him some hints of the midnight
revels, which were frequently carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>on between the inhabitants of the
adjacent Convents of Curwald and St.
Roswitha. He made enquiries of the
neighbouring peasants, who were no
friends of these ecclesiastical libertines;
their report confirmed the truth of
Wolfenrad’s assertions; and an old man
(who declared himself particularly well
informed respecting these disgraceful
secrets) added—“that on that very
night there was to be a superb entertainment
given to celebrate the conversion
of a Nun, who was the last admitted.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“You may easily guess, valiant
knight,” continued the old man, “what
they mean by her <i>conversion</i>. I suppose
the lady (I saw her brought into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Convent myself, and she seemed to be
an angel of innocence and beauty) was
a little violent at first; and so they
have at last succeeded in taming her
stern morality, as many another has
been tamed in the same way before
her.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Good heavens!” exclaimed one
of the least depraved among Count Donat’s
knights; “are such things spoken
of in these parts so openly, and yet is
Justice silent, and does the Bishop of
Coira take no notice of such abominations?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! the Lord have mercy on
me, Sir Knight,” answered the old
man, “such things are not talked of
<i>openly</i>, or so many fathers would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>plunge their children into yonder abyss
of infamy! I warrant you, the parents
of this converted damsel little thought,
when they sent her to St. Roswitha, that
they were placing the sweet creature in
Satan’s own claws.  But when one is
speaking to gallant warriors like yourselves,
who are able, and perhaps willing
to help us, one must be open-hearted.
I see that you are all well-armed,
and yonder tall gentleman with
his eye-brows bent so sternly and his
hands clenched seems to feel for what
we poor country-folks must suffer under
the dominion of these voluptuous
Monks, who make us contribute the
chief part of our hard-earned gains to
the support of their luxury.  As to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Bishop of Coira.... I am afraid, you
are in the right about him! The notice
which <i>he</i> takes.... Aye; were old
Hugo of Werdenberg still bishop indeed....
But the present Bishop....
Well! well! he and his boon-companion,
the Abbot of St. Gall, make a pair
of worthies indeed!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>While his knights were carrying on
this discourse with the peasants, their
Lord, whom fury had almost deprived
of his senses, was considering what was
to be done: the resolution which he
took was worthy of his character, was
worthy of no one but himself. Entrance
into either of the two convents
was demanded in vain; every other
proposal which his attendants suggested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>was rejected as incompetent to effect
his object; at length his commands
were obeyed, and by midnight St.
Roswitha’s Sanctuary was enveloped in
flames. It’s true, that a spark of paternal
love still glimmered in his heart for
the unfortunate Emmeline; but the
idea, that in all probability <i>she</i> also had
been <i>converted</i> after the fashion of the
sisterhood, soon extinguished it, and
he resolved to hide her and his shame
together in the ashes of St. Roswitha.
Impressed with this idea—“Drive them
back into the flames!” roared the inhuman
Donat, whenever either Friar or Nun
tried to rescue themselves from the conflagration,
without deigning to examine
whether Emmeline might not be one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>those unfortunates. The number of
monks, whom the flames compelled to
attempt their escape from St. Roswitha
at this undue time of night, confirmed
the reports of the mode of life practised
in the convents; and the dresses of the
Nuns, who had been arrayed for the
feast, proclaimed how little their hearts
were estranged from worldly vanities.
The fire continued to spread; it now
caught the adjacent Abbey of Curwald,
and before day-break there remained of
both the Sanctuaries and their infamous
inhabitants nothing but heaps of smoaking
ruins<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some historians date the burning of Cloister-Curwald
several years later than the period
adopted in this narrative.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Such was the cause of those flames,
whose reflexion on the sky excited so
much consternation at Sargans: Helen’s
heart had not throbbed with sad forebodings
without necessity. In the
course of the morning Donat returned
home, and returned without Emmeline!</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen flew to meet him, and eagerly
enquired, where was his daughter?
His answer was a short and cold narrative
of the dreadful transaction, which
had just taken place, and the consequence
was, that overpowered with
horror Helen fell senseless at the monster’s
feet. When she recovered, her
first words were to ask, where he had
placed Emmeline, (for she doubted not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>that previous to firing the Convent he
had provided for his daughter’s safety,)
and unfortunately her question was so
worded, that it betrayed her more intimate
knowledge of the business, than
was by any means suspected by Donat.
This discovery converted his unfeeling
coldness into a degree of fury,
that nearly approached delirium.
He seized her roughly by the arm,
and demanded, in a voice of thunder,
how she came to be so well acquainted
with his affairs? The unfortunate
knew no other way of extricating
herself from this dilemma, than repeating
what she had heard mentioned
by one of her attendants respecting
Wolfenrad’s letter, which (she confest)
had so strongly excited her anxiety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>about Emmeline, that she had not
scrupled to piece the fragments again
together. The storm of rage was now
diverted from Helen to the woman, who
had given her mistress this intelligence,
and who had it in her power to disclose
much more important secrets, if she
had thought proper.</p>

<p class='c018'>Incensed at Count Donat’s ill-treatment
of her, for which she considered
herself as indebted to Helen, Jutta resolved
to disclose in her turn all that
she thought most likely to injure her
mistress. Accordingly she began an
accusation, which among a thousand
falsehoods contained some truths, calculated
to make Helen shudder as she
listened to them.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The Countess (Jutta said) had some
time before received a packet from an
unknown messenger, who afterwards
quitted the Castle with all speed, and
whose arrival she ordered to be concealed
from her husband. She had also
received several letters from the hands
of the dying Bertha; after reading
which she had been frequently seen
loitering about the door of that chamber,
which (on account of the strange
noises frequently heard within) was
supposed to be haunted. Nay, on the
night before last she had actually tried
to force back the locks, but had been
scared away, by hearing Jutta’s rosary
fall on the ground, while she was watching
her Lady’s proceedings concealed behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>St. Martin’s statue. She had afterwards
seen through the key-hole the
Countess busily employed in writing,
and during the confusion which followed
Count Donat’s arrival, had found means
to get the letters into her possession;
which to confirm her story Jutta was
now ready to lay before him.</p>

<p class='c018'>These heavy charges against Helen
failed not to produce the effect intended.
Donat ordered the letters to be
brought immediately: He was no
scholar; yet was he not so totally deficient
in the knowledge of writing, but
that he could clearly decypher the addresses,
which were written in large
characters. His eyes flashed fire, while
he spelt the names of “Eginhart of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Torrenburg,” “the Abbot of Curwald,”
and “Urania Venosta, the widowed
Countess of Carlsheim and Sargans.”
These directions would have
been sufficient to condemn the poor
Helen, even had she been tried by a
more impartial judge. It was certain,
that these three persons were her husband’s
bitterest enemies; with what
propriety then could she be engaged
in  a secret correspondence with
them?  In particular, what motive
could she have for writing to the
Count of Torrenburg, who was her
former lover, and had been so long her
destined bridegroom?  Alas! poor
Helen! appearances were sorely against
thee! Nor would Donat’s fury give
him time to enquire further into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>business. In a paroxysm of rage he tore
the letters into a thousand fragments,
and pronounced Helen to be in a secret
correspondence with his implacable foe,
the Countess Urania for the purpose
of betraying him to his enemies; he asserted
also, that she had been privy to
the Abbot’s designs upon his daughter,
and had encouraged them in order to be
revenged on the father; and that she
was still in love with the Count of Torrenburg
and meant to have fled to him
from Sargans, an intention which was
sufficiently proved by her midnight efforts
to obtain entrance into that chamber,
which concealed a private outlet
from the Castle. It’s true, that finding
Emmeline had quitted that chamber of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>her own accord, and thinking the
knowledge of the secret passage might
be of use to himself on some future
occasion, the Abbot had not mentioned
to Count Donat his suspicions, that such
a passage existed; and the room had
been merely shut up from the report of
its being haunted. But Wolfenrad had
learned this secret from the perusal of
Amalberga’s letter to Emmeline, and
had communicated it to the Count,
hoping thereby to increase the merit of
his services. Now then Donat had no
doubt, that the noises, which had been
heard in that chamber, proceeded from
no ghosts, but from persons who were
waiting to assist his wife in her projected
flight. Under the influence of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>impressions, Helen was held convicted
of the most infamous designs, and condemned
to suffer the most exemplary
chastisement. She was instantly confined
in one of the strongest dungeons,
probably in that where Urania had shed
so many tears; in the mean while her
tyrant with his confidents and those
women of the Castle who were most
her enemies, sat in council to decide,
what punishment would be sufficiently
severe to suit her crime.</p>

<p class='c018'>I am in doubt as to Donat’s reasons
for not immediately proceeding to the
last extremities with his wife: that sentiment
towards her, which he had
chosen to dignify with the name of
love, had long ago disappeared; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>his late atrocious act, which had proved
the destruction of the whole Orders of
Curwald and St. Roswitha, had left
him no scruples to overcome. One
murder more or less, what did that signify
to a man, who had arrived at so
dreadful a height of guilt?—The most
probable cause for Donat’s moderation
was, <i>fear</i>: Helen was the Count of
Homburg’s daughter; was niece to the
Count of Mayenfield; and had been affianced
to the Count of Torrenburg,
who it was well known, would not suffer
her to be injured with impunity.
These considerations made Donat hesitate,
as to the course which he was now
to pursue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Donat past two days in resolving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>whether it would not be possible to
bring Helen to confess herself guilty.
This would justify him in the eyes of
her relations for any severity, which he
might think proper to inflict upon her;
but when he considered his wife’s character,
he saw little prospect of persuading
her to declare herself infamous.
In the mean while Helen was suffered to
remain tranquil in her dungeon; and
her husband was still meditating how to
avoid the vengeance of her friends,
when the Castle was unexpectedly attacked
by enemies incensed upon a different
account. He might indeed have
foreseen, that the Bishop of Coira
would not pass over the destruction of
Cloister-Curwald in silence; occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>however by his anger against Helen,
Donat had bestowed no thought upon
the Bishop; and the avengers of the
Monks of Curwald were at the gates of
Sargans, before any one had even bestowed
a thought on the possibility of
such an attack.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen heard from her prison the noise
of the assault, the shouts of the victors,
and the expiring groans of those who
fell beneath their swords; but her spirit
was too much broken to enable her to
guess at what was passing, or to offer
up prayers or wishes for the success of
either party. She lay almost in a state
of insensibility, when the door of her
dungeon was thrown open. The Count
of Carlsheim entered, snatched her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>rudely from the earth, and more by
gestures than speech, commanded her
attendance. She followed her conductor
in silence, like a lamb to the slaughter;
he saw, that she was scarcely able to
move through weakness, and either out
of compassion or cruelty compelled her
to swallow a cordial. She gradually recovered
herself sufficiently to remark,
that her husband was habited like a
pilgrim on the point of setting out
on some long journey, and that he
guided her towards a part of the Castle
remote from the clamour of the combat.
Here they found a domestic waiting
with a torch, who in a low voice and
with few words assured his Lord, that
the passage was still safe. A door, artfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>concealed in the wall, was now
unlocked, and Helen was commanded
to ascend the stair-case, which presented
itself before her.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was too wreak, too hopeless, to
think it worth while to make any reflections
on Donat’s unaccountable conduct
in regaining the upper apartments
of the fortress, (which, she was convinced,
was already in the enemy’s possession,)
instead of employing these precious
moments to effect his escape.
They now arrived at the door of that
chamber, which concealed the entrance
to the subterraneous passages: the
touch of a single key was sufficient to
make all the seven locks fly back. Donat
entered, and compelled his unhappy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>wife to follow him; he then took the
torch from the domestic, and commanded
him to execute his orders without
delay, and then to provide for his
own safety. The servant bowed, and
retired.</p>

<p class='c018'>Now then Helen was at length in
that very spot, which she had so anxiously
wished to visit, but not with
such a companion. Donat paused for
a moment; and she could hear distinctly,
that the domestic fastened the door
through which she had entered, not
omitting a single lock. Her tyrant
left her no time for reflecting on the
purpose for which she had been conducted
hither; he hastened to unclose
the secret door which led to Urania’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>baths, dragged her through it, and then
commanded her to proceed, having
first taken care to fasten the door after
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen obeyed, and as she moved
slowly forwards, through the subterraneous
passages, she observed that her
husband occasionally examined the side-walls
with his hand or foot. At length
he stopped before a small door half sunk
in the ground; he forced it open with
a violence which shook the whole cavern,
and held his torch within, in order
to examine it.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Yes, yes!” said he, “this is it!
Found in good time!—Helen, return!
or canst thou find the way through
these vaults without assistance?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>She dragged her feeble steps towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>him: he grasped her arm, and dashed
her with violence down a few steps terminating
in a small cave. She sank
on the ground with a shriek of pain,
which her tyrant answered by a burst
of diabolical laughter.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Here, traitress!” he exclaimed;
“here is the place of your punishment
and your perdition; and here is the last
nourishment, which you shall ever receive
on this side the grave. I give it
not out of compassion, but that you
may not perish in your present state of
stupor, and thus escape the sense of
what I have doomed you to suffer.—Eat!
revive to the full consciousness of
your misery; then die in agony, as
others have died here before you!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Thus saying, he placed by her side a
loaf of bread and a small flask of water,
which he had brought with him in his
pilgrim’s scrip. She was not in a condition
to make him any answer, and
listened in morbid silence, while he quitted
the cave, flinging the door after him
with violence, and carefully barricading
it on the outside to prevent her escape.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nothing now animated the frame of
Helen but mere animal life; and even
that was half extinguished by the shock
which she had sustained the day before
and by long abstinence from all nourishment.
She was scarcely conscious of
what had past, and it afterwards cost
her no little difficulty to recall the recollection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of it. Instinct made her
seize eagerly the food, of which she
had so long been deprived; and the relief,
which this afforded her, was the
first thing, which brought her to herself,
and gave her spirits to ask the question—“What
has happened to me?
Whither have I been conveyed?”—She
thought, that she must be the sport of
some fantastic vision, and with the sensation
of being totally exhausted she
closed her eyes, and endeavoured to end
her dream.</p>

<p class='c018'>A violent shock, which made the
hollow ground tremble beneath her,
forced her to start up in terror; and
she now had strength and recollection
sufficient to rush forward a few paces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>which brought her to the steps, down
which Count Donat had so lately dashed
her. An instant after she was sensible
of a second shock like that of an earthquake,
and which was accompanied by a
noise so loud, that for a few moments
she was completely stunned. On recovering
herself, she was sensible of
a strong current of air blowing into the
cave: her heart beat violently with
hope and fear, while she thought it
possible, that the late earthquake
might have forced the dungeon open.
She hastened up the steps, and with
rapture ascertained by the touch
that the door had been driven from
its fastenings, and that nothing prevented
her from quitting her prison.
With as much speed, as her extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>weakness and the total obscurity would
permit, she hastened to profit by this
interposition of Providence. She crept
along slowly and cautiously, when on
turning a corner she perceived a distant
gleam of light. With increased hopes
she made the best of her way towards
it, and found, that it proceeded from
Count Donat’s torch, as it lay half extinguished
in the rubbish, among which
it had fallen.</p>

<p class='c018'>Without giving herself time to guess,
what motive could have induced her
husband to throw away his only guide
through the gloom, or how he could
have found his way out of these intricate
passages without its aid, she caught
it eagerly from the ground, cleared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>wick from the dust with which it was
clogged, and made the flame burn
brightly; while she frequently cast a
look of anxiety round her, lest some
one should be advancing to rob her of
this invaluable prize. This apprehension
made her proceed with still greater
exertion of speed; but she had not gone
far, before her way was barred by large
heaps of stones and earth: she fancied
too, that she heard a faint murmur at
no great distance, like some one groaning.
She stopped; she listened;—it
struck her, that from beneath a pile of
stones, which seemed to have lately
fallen down, there came a voice, whose
accents were familiar to her; but before
she could recover herself from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>horror, which this idea occasioned her
sufficiently to ascertain the truth of her
suspicions, a third shock, similar to the
two first, but if possible more violent
and terrible, overpowered her faculties
so completely, that she sank upon the
earth, unable to move for several minutes.
Fortunately her torch was not
extinguished by her fall. She rose; the
way, so lately open before her, was
now completely blocked up by the
earth, which had fallen in; and it seemed
to her in the first moments of terror,
that she saw the roof tottering above,
and felt the ground giving way beneath
her. Fear gave her strength, and she
fled hastily down a side passage, which
accident presented to her, nor rested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>till she thought, that the place, which she
had reached, was not totally unknown
to her. She stopped, and looking down
discovered lying on the earth, torn from
its hinges, and considerably shattered
the low door of that dungeon, which
Donat had destined for her grave.</p>

<p class='c018'>She now exerted her whole strength
to pass onwards, without falling into an
enormous chasm, which had been formed
by the late convulsion, and which occupied
almost the whole breadth of the
passage. She shuddered, as she remarked,
that the earth had fallen into
the dungeon, and would infallibly have
smothered her, had she remained there
but a few minutes longer.</p>

<p class='c018'>She reached the opposite side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>chasm with much difficulty, but unhurt.
She was now certain, that the
Castle was at no great distance: but
she dreaded either to miss the proper
road, or to find it rendered impassable
by earth and rubbish. Should either
happen, she had no alternative left but
perishing of hunger in these frightful
dungeons: nor had she much time left
her for deliberation, since her torch already
began to draw towards its end.
Observing this, she rushed forwards
with desperate resolution, and committed
herself to the guidance of chance.
Accident, or rather a benevolent Providence
directed her footsteps; and she
reached the staircase and Urania’s chamber,
before her strength entirely failed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>her. Here then she rested at length;
but that rest was insensibility.</p>

<p class='c018'>After some time her recollection returned.
She raised herself, and saw
with surprise, that the chamber, which
Donat to favour his escape had caused
to be fastened so carefully, was filled
with people. She felt, that they conveyed
her to a couch, and rendered her
every possible assistance; and she heard
them make a thousand kind enquiries
respecting her health and her wishes:
but her strength both of mind and body
was so completely exhausted, that she
found it impossible to pronounce a word,
or even make a sign, that she was sensible
of their attentions.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was pain, which enabled her to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the first token of sensation. Her arms
and bosom were much bruised, and the
blood streamed copiously from a wound
on her head. She has never been able
to recollect, whether she received these
injuries, when Donat threw her down
the dungeon steps, or from her being
struck by the falling stones while making
her escape. The persons, who surrounded
her couch, lost no time in binding
up her wounds, and the pain of this
operation forced from her a feeble cry.
Finding that she was now sensible, they
repeated their enquiries as to what had
happened to her, and how she had been
brought into so terrible a condition. She
stammered out the word “earthquake!”
Where was Count Donat, was the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>demand, which she answered by pointing
to the private door conducting to
the vaults.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was soon removed to a more
quiet chamber, and the care which was
taken of her convinced her, that she
had not fallen into the hands of enemies.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the fourth day she was already
declared to be convalescent; and it was
announced to her, that the Commander
of the Bishop of Coira’s forces, which
had, conquered the Castle, requested
an audience of her. She consented
to receive him, and shortly after a
young man of prepossessing appearance
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Noble Lady,” said he, “though
you are the wife of the cruel owner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>this fortress, we are well aware, that
you are not a partner in his crimes.
His people are some of them slain;
others have betaken themselves to
flight; and it is in vain, that we have
endeavoured to find the place of his
concealment. Your pointing out the
door into the vaults has not been sufficient;
he cannot have made his escape
through that passage, since the
falling-in of the roof has rendered it impracticable;
and had he in his flight
been overtaken by the vengeance of
Heaven, how could <i>you</i> have avoided
the sharing his fate? Be frank with
us, noble Lady; I conjure you in the
name of humanity, tell us, where he is
concealed, and depend on our dealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>better with him, than he has been accustomed
to deal with others.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen mustered up all her strength,
and endeavoured to relate the circumstances
of her escape: but anxiety to be
as brief as possible, and her endeavours
to conceal Donat’s ill-usage of her,
(which she thought, duty to her husband
forbade her revealing,) rendered
every thing she said obscure and improbable.
She mentioned the earthquake,
and to prove it showed the
bruises and wounds, which it had occasioned
her. The stranger, however,
assured her, that she must have received
them in some other manner, for that
no one in the Castle had perceived the
slightest symptoms of an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Helen, however, endeavoured to establish
her assertion; and while recalling
the various circumstances which
had passed in the caverns, she suddenly
recollected the groans, which had struck
her hearing. She earnestly entreated,
that the heap of rubbish might be examined;
she was obeyed; the stones
were removed, and beneath them was
discovered the shattered and lifeless
form of the Count of Carlsheim.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was now the general opinion, that
the violence which Donat had used in
forcing open the dungeon-door, had
shattered the rotten cavern, had made
the supports crack, and had brought
down the roof, whose fall had involved
in it his own destruction.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Helen’s horror at this discovery, her
urgent entreaties that the corse might
have christian burial, and the many
hours which she past in prayers for the
repose of Donat’s spirit, startled the present
masters of the Castle not a little.
They began to suspect, that she was not
by any means so innocent a creature,
and so unfortunate a victim of conjugal
tyranny, as she had been represented,
and as in truth she was. They therefore
ceased to trouble her with questions,
considering her as the confidante
and accomplice of Count Donat’s
crimes; but as they had no other fault
to lay to her charge, and as the power
of her relations compelled them to
treat her with respect, as soon as she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>sufficiently recovered, she was removed
to the Convent of Zurich, and left there
with a hint by no means equivocal,—“that
all things considered, she would
do well to pass the remainder of her
days within that sanctuary.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen’s joy at understanding, that she
had been conveyed to Zurich, was indescribable:
she immediately requested to
see the venerable Countess Urania, and
discovered to the patroness of her mother both
herself and all that had happened.
It was now, that her fate seemed disposed
to abate its severity. In an unrestrained
intercourse with this excellent
woman, who received her with open
arms, and to whom she unveiled her
whole heart, she looked forward to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>life of tranquil happiness. Urania’s
conversation poured balsam into her
wounded soul, and explained to her
many things, which had hitherto appeared
to her unaccountable. Donat’s resolution
to make her his wife was produced
by a former passion, which he had entertained
for her mother, and by a desire
to be revenged on her father, the
Count of Homburg; and that unknown
cavern to which he had conducted her,
was doubtless the same, in which (as it
was reported) the worthy father of
such a son had starved to death two of
the fugitive monks of Curwald. Oh!
Towers of Sargans, what crimes have
been committed within your gloomy
bounds! And will then the vengeance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of the Eternal Judge sleep for ever?
Will neither the heavens rain down fire
to consume you, nor the earth unclose
to swallow you in its womb, and thus
prevent you from reminding posterity
of those horrible acts, to which you
have been so long a witness?—Yet the
blood of your barbarous master has purified
you, and you are now the abode
of innocence and virtue. Peace, long
peace be with you, and be with your
lawful possessors; and may the curse
of retribution only fall on those, who
shall dare to deprive those possessors of
their right!</p>

<p class='c018'>Solitude and experience sometimes
endow the soul, which has withdrawn
itself from earth to devote itself to
Heaven, with a prophetic power. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>now I see into futurity! I see, that the
family of Carlsheim and Sargans, which
has already suffered so much, has still
much more to suffer; but again I say it—“Alas
for those, by whom the descendants
of Amalberga and Emmeline
shall be robbed of their lawful inheritance,
and compelled to experience the
calamities of their predecessors.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I have deviated from my narrative,
to which I now return.—Helen lived
tranquil by Urania’s side, equally unconscious
of the evil reports, which
were circulated respecting her late misfortunes
by her enemies, and of the benevolent
intentions of her powerful
friends. Her parents soon visited her
at Zurich, and now that she was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>widow, requested her to accept the
hand of her former bridegroom, the
Count of Torrenburg: but Helen knew
but too well, that no Count of Torrenburg
existed for <i>her</i>. She had courageously
torn his image from her
heart; and she avowed to her friends
her knowledge of his passion for Amalberga,
and declared, that to see them
happy in the possession of each other
was now the only wish of her heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helen’s relations listened to this declaration
with no trifling regret: they
would willingly have rewarded her for
her past sufferings by the certainty, that
the remainder of her life would be past
in happiness with one of the noblest of
Helvetian youths. But they had brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with them (for the purpose of persuading
Helen to the proposed marriage)
some of Torrenburg’s relations,
to whom his passion for Amalberga
was by no means so unpleasant a subject.
She was now a rich heiress; as Count
Donat’s only surviving daughter, she
was entitled to the extensive domains of
Carlsheim and Sargans, and consequently
she was a much more advantageous
match than Helen. This gave rise to
some disputes between the friends of
the different parties: but the solemn declaration
of Count Donat’s widow, that
she never would lay aside that name, at
length silenced every opposition; and
she obtained from them all a promise,
that they would mutually exert themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to accomplish the only wish, which
she indulged on this side of the grave;
namely, the union of Eginhart of Torrenburg
with Amalberga of Sargans.
They were informed by her, that according
to Amabel’s letter the lady was
concealed in the Convent of Engelberg,
and thither they hastened to apprize her
of the happiness, which awaited her.</p>

<p class='c018'>I need not say, that they sought her
there in vain; the Count of Torrenburg’s
endeavours to discover her were also unsuccessful,
till the arrival of Bloomberg,
who assured him, that she must be in
Landenberg’s power, and that the most
likely place to look for her was the Fortress
of Rassburg. The consequence of
this information was a bond of union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>between Torrenburg and the Friends of
Freedom against Landenberg and his
brother in iniquity, the insolent Gessler;
and the Count immediately accompanied
Bloomberg to Stein, that
he might consult with his new allies
the best means for effecting Landenberg’s
overthrow and Amalberga’s
deliverance.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the mean while William Tell’s
plan, for throwing off the Governor’s
yoke, and asserting the liberty of his
beloved country, had been gradually
ripening. The impression, which he and
his friends, Walter Forest, Bernsdorf,
and the two Melthals, had made upon
the general mind was great, and their
adherents were numerous; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>success of their enterprise still depended
entirely upon its being kept a profound
secret. Those men, whose plans were
soon to burst out into flames terrible as
the explosion of a volcano, and to give
posterity an example of heroic devotion
to the cause of Freedom, were as
yet compelled to work in darkness, and
arrange their vast designs in corners and
by stealth.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was not till the 28th of December
(being the Festival of St. Alexander) that
they ventured to muster their numbers
in a large meadow near the Lake of the
Four Cantons; this was to be their last
conference, and even this they took the
precaution of holding under covert of
the night. The Count of Torrenburg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and Edmund Bloomberg were also present;
but the former by his impatience
had nearly ruined the whole design.
Conscious of his exalted station, and of
the valour of his new allies, he could
not endure the degrading idea of skulking
about in darkness and concealment,
as if he were plotting the execution
of some crime. He insisted upon an instant
declaration of hostility against
Landenberg, and that an attempt to rescue
his beloved should be made without
delay: it was not without difficulty
that William Tell convinced him, how
impossible it would be to rescue Amalberga
any other way than by artifice,
without exposing her to the most imminent
danger; and that he persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>him to wait patiently till St. Sylvester’s
Eve, when (it was determined) the tyrant
should have an open and forcible
attack made upon him; though in making
that attack, there would still be an
absolute necessity for conducting it with
the utmost caution.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amalberga’s friends had obtained
some intelligence respecting her present
situation. One of Arnold Melthal’s sons,
a spirited lad, equally well adapted to
daring enterprise and the winding
paths of artifice, found means to
enter the Fortress of Rassburg in disguise,
and examine whether any
thing could be attempted towards
the rescue of the lady. During her
abode on the banks of the Lake of Thun,
her sweetness and humility of manners;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>her majestic air accompanied by the
condescension of an angel; the little
difference which she seemed to make
between herself and the girls of the village,
whom she honoured with the
name of her companions; all these together
had made her an universal favourite;
and had not every appearance
of a chain been hateful in the eyes of
the sons of Freedom, it would have
been easy for Amalberga to have established
herself as the queen of one of
the best people that the earth holds,
and to have mounted Helvetia’s throne
by general acclamation.</p>

<p class='c018'>To an eager desire for rescuing this
adored lady from the power of Landenberg,
was now united the wish to gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>possession of the strong Castle of Rassburg;
which would secure to Helvetia
the success of all those mighty plans,
whose accomplishment still lay concealed
within the bosom of futurity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Alwyn, Arnold Melthal’s son, when
he ventured to approach the fortress in
disguise, was not aware, that his was
one of those countenances, which cannot
pass unobserved. Fortunately, the
eyes, whose notice he attracted, were
those of one, by whom features like his
were seldom viewed with displeasure.
Landenberg happened to be absent, and
had left his fair prisoner to the charge
of a female attendant, who had formerly
stood high in his estimation for
the sake of her own beauty, and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>now preserved her influence with him
by condescending to watch over those,
who were in present possession of that
heart, to which she was herself become
indifferent.  Well skilled in manly
beauty, she no sooner saw Alwyn pass
along with a bucket on his head (for he
had obtained entrance into Rassburg
under the disguise of a common water-carrier)
than she was convinced of his
being something better, than his dress
denoted. She accosted, and questioned
him. His affected simplicity could not
deceive her; and he saw himself compelled
either to adopt some artifice, or
to be reduced to that suspicious silence,
which in such a situation would have
been scarcely better than a confession of
the truth.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>—“And so you continue to deny,”
continued the girl, “that there is any
secret reason for a man like you being
here, habited in a manner to which, I am
certain, you have never been accustomed?
Young man, be frank with me!
I should be sorry to give you over to
some other questioner, who might use
rough means to obtain an answer, or to
order that you should be kept in custody,
till the Governor returns. Then
tell me honestly at once, who you are,
and what motive has brought you
hither?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Alwyn during this speech had examined
the countenance of his new acquaintance,
and fancied, that he could
read in it marks of a partiality for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>by no means doubtful. His resolution
was taken in a moment, and he threw
himself at her feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What brought me hither?” he
exclaimed; “’twas Love, most beautiful
of all earthly creatures! But who I
am.... Ah! shall I dare to avow myself
one of the lowliest among the inhabitants
of yonder valley, and thus make
it certain, that my suit will be rejected,
and myself driven with scorn from the
presence of her whom I adore?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And who is it that you adore?”
demanded Ursula.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You, lovely angel! you!” he
exclaimed passionately, while he seized
her hand, and prest upon it a thousand
kisses; “my heart is devoted to you
alone, and your cruelty will kill me!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>The astonished and delighted Ursula
forced herself from his embrace, and
fled; but it was not long before she returned,
anxious to convince herself,
that her half-faded charms had really
made so valuable a conquest. To make
a woman’s vanity believe any thing
flattering, Heaven knows, is no difficult
task; and half an hour was sufficient
to leave her no doubt of her triumph.
She soon grew weary of playing the
prude, and she gave him to understand,
that he would not find her heart
absolutely marble; and thus did the
handsome Alwyn find himself involved
in an amour, at whose termination he
could not guess, and of which, while it
lasted, he thought, that he had but little
reason to be vain.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>At present he reaped no great advantages
from his artifice. It was impossible
to get a sight of Amalberga, or
convey to her a hint, that her friends
in the valley were making preparations
for her rescue. He was also soon compelled
to retire by the return of the
Governor, who was now frequently absent
for days together from Rassburg
on account of the popular disturbances,
and who could only bestow a few isolated
hours on the prosecution of his
suit to the heiress of Sargans. As soon
as the warder’s horn announced the
Governor’s return, Ursula (who trembled,
lest her supposed lover should be
discovered by others, as he had been by
her) requested him to be gone; yet still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>there was a secret means left for him to
gain entrance into the fortress of the
rock, which (disagreeable as it was) for
Amalberga’s sake and the general advantage,
he did not refuse to employ.
At midnight his doating inamorata
used to let a bucket down through a
chasm in the wall; the rock was steep
and flat; the unwilling Lover was then
drawn up to the top, where he was
obliged to purchase every little scrap of
intelligence, which it was requisite for
him to know, by a thousand lies and
flattering speeches; every one of which,
to an heart filled with Helvetian honesty,
was scarcely less painful than the stab of
a dagger.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was rewarded, however, for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>sacrifice by obtaining the important information,
that hitherto Landenberg’s
behaviour towards the Lady of Sargans
had been restrained within the limits of
the most respectful adoration: but that
he had assured her with the most dreadful
imprecations, that a period was
fixed, beyond which he would no longer
submit to be the patient victim of her
severity. The first day of the ensuing
year, he was determined, should make
the cruel beauty completely his by fair
means or by force. This intelligence
induced Alwyn to be more frequent in
his midnight visits; he repeated them,
till every part of the fortress was become
perfectly familiar, and till every
little circumstance had been carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>gleaned by him, which might assist his
friends in their design of storming the
fort and rescuing the lovely captive.</p>

<p class='c018'>By the Festival of St. Sylvester every
necessary preparation was completed;
and all the machines were ready to be
worked at once in various parts of the
country, which might secure the success
of an enterprise, of whose views
the release of an imprisoned damsel
made but a very trifling part—those
views were of the most extensive nature;
yet if the plan had failed, in spite
of the justice of Tell’s cause posterity
would no doubt have branded him with
the name of rebel, and confounded
him with the common herd of unsuccessful
adventurers, who have dared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>attempt objects beyond their power to
attain. But as his plan was arranged
with the utmost foresight, and its execution
was followed with the most prosperous
issue, after-ages have viewed
his deed with admiration, have reckoned
it as the proudest triumph of the
rights of nature over cruelty and oppression,
and have bestowed on its author
the title of a Hero: so certain is it,
that actions are almost always weighed
according to their result, and the most
impartial judge (without being aware
of it) is frequently induced to decide
unfairly of events, dazzled by the lustre
of the success with which they were
attended.</p>

<p class='c018'>Had nothing but the Count of Torrenburg’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>inclination been consulted, the
attempt, which was to decide upon his future
happiness or despair, would not
have been deferred till the latest day
possible; neither when it <i>was</i> made,
would so small a number of men have
been employed to carry it into effect.
Perhaps in this respect something would
have been sacrificed in consideration of
the impatience natural to a lover; but
Helvetia’s deliverers were not without a
certain portion of that obstinacy, which
so often accompanies valour and resolution.
Torrenburg’s opinion would
doubtless have had more influence with
them, had he not been a nobleman and
one who was able to bring so powerful
a force either to their aid or against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>them. They considered the most distant
trace of authority over them with
abhorrence, and were determined, that
every step, which they made in the service
of liberty, should be taken of their
own free will. It was certain, that the
fortress was but ill garrisoned, and that
its security consisted solely in its inaccessible
situation: in spite therefore of
Torrenburg’s entreaties and anger, they
resolved, that no more than one hundred
men should be allotted for this service;
and among these the jealous Helvetians,
who could not endure that any
hands but their own should break their
fetters, would not suffer one of Torrenburg’s
warriors to be introduced. It
was not without some difficulty, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the Count obtained permission to accompany
the party himself, and to be
the next to Alwyn Melthal, who should
penetrate into the Castle of Rassburg.</p>

<p class='c018'>Never did any summer’s day seem so
long to the Count as St. Sylvester’s,
while he waited with impatience for the
departure of light. No sooner was it
dark, than the allies began to assemble
by twos and threes from different quarters.
It was one of the most gloomy
winter nights, that ever favoured a secret
enterprise; and the glimmering
taper, which was the usual signal for
Alwyn to ascend the wall, was not yet
discernible. Midnight was already past;
still there was no token of Ursula’s approach;
when suddenly the trampling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of horses was heard, and the gleam of
approaching torches showed them a
body of soldiers coming from the Castle
by a path, which was well guarded by
sentinels and provided with several
draw-bridges. Landenberg was at the
head of the troop. Unmoved by her
tears and fainting, he had just informed
Amalberga, that he should return the
next day to hear her final decision; and
he was now bending his course to Sarno,
in order to exact the usual new-year’s
gift from the inhabitants of the
Valley, and hear them renew the oath
of submission to their Leige-Lord, the
Emperor. It was an established custom
of the vice-gerents to receive from the
hands of the vassals on the first day of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the new year, what little had escaped
their extortion during the old one; in return
for which they never failed to
promise greater indulgence for the future,
nor in spite of that promise to
conduct themselves with increased oppression.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he journeyed onwards, Landenberg
recapitulated to himself the advantages,
which this year had produced to
him; the quantity of wealth which he
had collected in gold, jewels, and other
valuables; the possession of the lovely
Amalberga, whom he already looked
upon as his own; and above all, the
power of throwing off the wearisome
mask of hypocrisy, which he had at first
been compelled to assume.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>—“As to Gessler’s death,” said he to
himself, “that has rather improved my
situation, than done me any harm. It
has relieved me from the rival of my
greatness, and authorises me to exercise
that severity, which is necessary for
my own views, under the fair-sounding
name of just revenge. These late unavailing
efforts to oppose my will have
convinced me, that I have to do with a
weak, powerless people, who may be
incensed indeed so far as to make some
show of resistance at first, but whom
firmness and chastisement will soon reduce
within the limits of abject submission.
There are not many Tells among
them, God be thanked! He was the
only man whom I feared, and luckily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>he is either dead, or a voluntary exile in
some distant country; report says the
former; but let him be where he will,
so he be not here to spirit up my slaves
against me with his poisonous influence.
<i>My</i> slaves? Right; they are mine, no
other’s. The ensuing year will, I trust,
make clear to the world, for <i>whom</i> I am
labouring, and whose advantage and
peril are most implicated in the business!
Then when I have attained the
height at which I aim, doubtless my
new dignity being shared with their
adored Amalberga will have no slight
influence in reconciling these people to
my authority; and her popularity will
induce them to protect her husband
against the wrath of the deceived Emperor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>The precious prize once secure,
I shall then have no need of this assumed
severity; the affection of my subjects
will suffice to preserve them in
obedience; I shall be at liberty to follow
the bent of my inclinations by ruling with
a gentle sway; and all of us will at once
be made happy, Amalberga, myself, and
the country which we govern.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Such was the subject of Landenberg’s
reflections, many of which he occasionally
imparted to some of his confidential
attendants, as he rode along, totally unconscious
of the foes so near him, and
of the danger which threatened the
speedy overthrow of all his ambitious
hopes and projects. Here and there a
sentence or two spoken in a louder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>voice than ordinary reached the hearing
of the Helvetians, who were concealed
among the various caverns Of the Castle-rock:
 and then was many a sword half
drawn from the scabbard to impose
eternal silence upon the insolent boaster.
The vigilance of the prudent chiefs,
however, and consideration for the
public welfare compelled them to repress
their unseasonable zeal. An over-hasty
attack would have been sufficient to ruin
every thing. Landenberg, it’s true,
would probably have perished, but only
to make room for a successor perhaps
even worse than himself. The object
here was not to make away with a single
tyrant; no, it was to throw off a disgraceful
yoke for ever, and to bequeath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the precious treasure Liberty to their
children, and to the children of their
children even down to the latest posterity.
Landenberg therefore was suffered
to proceed with his attendants unmolested;
nothing gave them warning of
the danger, which lurked so near, except
now and then a low whispering
noise among the brambles, which made
their hair stand an end, for it was now
the ghostly hour; and as they dreaded
its being something supernatural, the
sound only served to make those who
heard it pursue their course with the
greater speed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Scarcely had the last horseman disappeared
in the farther part of the Valley,
or rather scarcely had darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>dropt her thick curtain between the enemies;
scarcely had the mountain-echoes
ceased to reverberate the last sound of
the hoofs of their steeds, when Alwyn’s
guiding-star made its appearance: Ursula’s
lamp was seen glimmering on the
battlements above. A few hasty words
were spoken among the confederates respecting
the conduct of the enterprise;
the last directions were given; and
then young Melthal sprang into the
bucket destined to convey him to her
who expected him so impatiently, and
whom he now met for the last time
with expressions of pretended love. It
was no trifling sacrifice, which poor Alwyn
made on this occasion to the general
welfare. To conceal the feelings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>his honest guileless heart; to dissemble
love for one who was totally indifferent
to him; in many a rude tempestuous
night to encounter dangers, such as nothing
but the most sincere and ardent
passion would have induced any other
man to risk; and then at last to throw
aside the mask, and to hear himself
called a betrayer and a hypocrite, and
called so with justice; this task was a
most painful one, and keenly did Alwyn
feel that his situation was disgraceful.
Yet he thought, that even <i>this</i> sacrifice
was not too much to make for
his native land; and duty and patriotism
made him submit to do that, which
was of all things the most cruel to his
feelings, and repugnant to his nature;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>they made him submit to play the hypocrite.</p>

<p class='c018'>Silently lamenting the ignominious
character which he was obliged to sustain,
Alwyn followed his supposed mistress
to a retired chamber, where (she
told him) they should be secure from
disturbance till morning; for hitherto
the fear of discovery had only suffered
their interviews to last for a few minutes.
But at the moment when she
expected to receive the kiss of ardent
love, and when she turned to her lover
after having carefully closed the door,
to her utter astonishment a gag was
forced into her half-opened mouth; and
then seizing her arms, her supposed
admirer fastened them with strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>cords to the bed-posts. It is true, that
the general safety had been declared to
require the death of this wretched creature;
but the noble heart of Alwyn
revolted at the idea. Even the precautions,
which circumstances now made it
absolutely necessary for him to take,
caused his cheeks to burn with indignation
against himself; he took care to
confine Ursula’s hands in such a way,
that the pressure of the bonds could
give her no pain; nor could he resolve
to leave even a creature, whom in his
heart he despised, a prey to absolute
despair.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Fear nothing, Ursula,” said he
in a gentle voice, while quitting the
room; “every thing shall be explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>shortly, and on my soul no harm shall
happen to you”—a promise, which was
religiously fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Alwyn now hastened back to the battlements,
and drew up the Count of
Torrenburg in the same manner, by which
he had ascended himself; and anxious
as Eginhart was to fly to Amalberga’s
assistance, still did he not quit his station,
till two more of the confederates
were safely landed on the platform of
the Castle. These in their turn rendered
the same service to their companions,
and a sufficient number were
soon mustered within the wails to authorize
their proceeding to more hazardous
attempts. Half of them seized
the sleeping sentinels, while the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>without noise made the best of their
way to the great gate. They opened
it, and the approach through the rock
was soon made practicable for the remainder
of their friends, whom time
had not permitted to ascend in the
bucket.</p>

<p class='c018'>No slight expectations had been entertained
by the Helvetians, that this
midnight attack would have made them
masters of Rassburg, without its costing
them a single drop of blood; but
they had miscounted the strength of the
garrison. Sufficient opposition was
made to compel the besiegers to purchase
their conquest dearly. Many a
brave Helvetian bit the dust, and shared
the grave of the enemy, who had just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>expired at his feet. The dawn of morning
discovered the walls of the Castle of
the Rock dyed with the blood both of
friends and foes. By the time that the
sun was fully risen, the work was completed;
Helvetia’s sons had achieved their
object, and the sheaths once more received
their bloody swords. The chiefs
now employed themselves in giving orders
and making dispositions to preserve their
conquest, while Torrenburg flew to deliver
his Amalberga. He found her in a
stately chamber; she was on her knees
praying for <i>him</i>. The noise of the combat
had roused her from sleep; yet convinced
that her situation could not alter for the
worse, she experienced no alarm for herself,
till as the clash of arms occasionally
drew nearer to her chamber door, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>heard the name of Torrenburg shouted,
and concluded, that he was among the
combatants: then <i>indeed</i> she trembled,
and sought refuge from her terrors in supplication
to her Patron-Saint. The heart
of the pious girl was full of confidence in
the Divine justice: she doubted not, that
the Ruler of all things had decreed every
thing for the best; she knew, that neither
herself nor Torrenburg had <i>merited</i> to suffer,
and she trusted, that Heaven would
act towards her with gentleness. In her
supplications therefore she rather spoke of
the goodness of Providence, than implored
its help: or if she prayed for any thing, it
was that a speedy stop might be put to
the shedding of blood, of whose flowing
she was but too well convinced by the
clashing of arms, and the dying groans of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>some, who were slaughtered at no great
distance from her chamber.</p>

<p class='c018'>A long and fearful silence now succeeded.
Suddenly her door was thrown open,
and a knight in complete armour entered
the room. He hastened towards her,
raised his visor, and well did she recollect
the noble countenance of him, whose
portrait was engraved on her heart in characters
indelible: but she recollected also
his engagements to Helen; she was conscious
of her danger and the weakness of
her heart, and attempted to force away
the hand, which he had seized, and prest
to his lips with passion. It was long, before
she recovered from her surprise and
confusion sufficiently to comprehend the
whole extent of those delightful views,
which were now presented before her by
indulgent Fortune.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>A Nun is but a sorry describer of love-scenes;
and she, who traces this narrative,
though she may not perhaps have always
been a stranger to tender sentiments, still
is unwilling to dwell longer than is necessary
upon those, which filled the heart of
the happy Amalberga, when she sank into
her lover’s arms, and murmured—“Torrenburg,
I am thine!”—I have since been
assured, that in these first moments of
rapture the name of Helen was not forgotten.
In truth some trifling recollection,
some little portion of gratitude at least
was due to the unfortunate, who to procure
the happiness of Amalberga and Torrenburg
had not hesitated to immolate her
own. The sacrifice was indeed a most
difficult and painful one; but never did
Helen once regret, that she had made it.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>While the lovers forgot every thing in
the contemplation of those flattering prospects,
which futurity showed them on all
sides; and while the Helvetians were employed
in taking every possible precaution,
that might preserve to them the Fortress,
of which they had so valiantly obtained
possession; the other Patriots (as had been
previously arranged) were carrying their
glorious designs into execution in different
parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peregrine of Landenberg had reached
Castle-Sarno before day-break. He slept
for a few hours, and then rose to welcome
the day, which, he was determined, should
see him the husband of the Heiress of Sargans.
He had commanded, that towards
evening a strong guard should conduct her
thither from Rassburg, when a Friar, belonging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to the Abbot of St. Gall, and
who was entirely devoted to the Governor,
had engaged to perform the marriage ceremony
between them: whether with her
consent, or without it, the good father
cared but little.</p>

<p class='c018'>Anxious to give as creditable an appearance
as possible to this most important
transaction of his life, Landenberg thought
it best for the general edification to open
the day’s business by walking in solemn
procession to the neighbouring church.
For this purpose he was already descending
the great staircase accompanied by a
numerous train of courtiers, when he was
informed, that the inhabitants of the adjacent
districts had assembled in the valley
below, each bringing the accustomed
New-year’s offering.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Landenberg had great confidence in
omens; he looked upon it as a pledge of
future good fortune, that before he had
set his foot without the Castle-walls, his
course was impeded by presents.  The
procession to the church was deferred for
awhile: part of his attendants were sent to
take charge of the gifts, which had been
brought to him; of the fatted oxen, the
corn, the fruit, the cloth woven by the
skilful hands of the industrious Helvetian
housewives; the casks of wine; and here
and there a few bags of coin, which were
not the least welcome part of the offerings.
In the mean while the Governor
himself remained in the front-court, attended
by a few of his most confidential
attendants, and prepared for the reception
of “the slaves of his servants,” as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>was usual for him to term the brave Helvetians.</p>

<p class='c018'>The deputation arrived. It consisted of
fifty persons, with Henric Melthal at their
head, Henric, on whose locks eighty winters
had now shed their snows.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Lord Governor,” said the venerable
man, approaching Landenberg, “the
old year expired yesterday; the new one
begins to-day. How you have sustained
the character of Imperial Majesty among
the opprest children of a free-born nation,
that is <i>your</i> affair. How we begin the new,
is <i>our’s</i>! Be God the judge between you
and us, Peregrine of Landenberg; God,
who has already judged Gessler, as he will
judge you! But as for you, my sons, do
as ye see me do, nor hesitate to lay down
your lives in the cause of liberty and justice.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>It is inconceivable to me, how the daring
old man was suffered to proceed so far
in his speech. The Almighty must have
struck a panic into the tyrant and his
base dependents; but now recovering
themselves, they hastily drew their side-weapons,
which (from being rather intended
for ornament than use, and able to
do but little injury) were generally called
“holy-swords.” Some, who were unprovided
with even these weak instruments,
hastened into the Castle in search
of arms; in the mean while old Melthal
and his trusty companions had drawn concealed
pike-heads from under their cloaks,
which they fixed dexterously and with
promptitude on the tops of their long
white staves; and now was the signal
given for beginning a massacre, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>once commenced was not concluded hastily.
Among the first who fell was the Governor.
The feeble arm of Henric Melthal,
strengthened by Heaven and the justice
of his cause, gave the decisive blow;
and Edmund Bloomberg hastened to extricate
his father-in-law from the crowd of
those, who (now that they were recovered
from their first consternation) prest on
him to destroy the slayer of their chief.
Landenberg cursed his fate, that he should
fall so disgracefully by the arm of a dotard,
and poured out his last breath in execrations.
The combat became general. The
Friends of Liberty were attacked by the
Governor’s remaining attendants, who
were now better armed; but this opposition
was not of much avail, since at a
given signal a second party of Helvetians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>who were in waiting on the outside of
the Castle, hastened to support their confederates.</p>

<p class='c018'>The superiority of numbers being now
on their side, the conquerors proclaimed
quarter in the name of Henric Melthal.
The loss of their chief had deprived the
scanty band of his adherents of all their
courage: they were glad to sheathe their
weapons, and the conquering Helvetians
took them under their protection, and
conducted them uninjured to the boundaries.
The gallant men were unwilling to
stain their native soil with blood shed unnecessarily,
and doubted not, that such a
barbarous measure would have induced
the Almighty to withdraw his blessing
from their enterprise. They lost no time
in taking measures for maintaining themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in the possession of Castle-Sarno.
Towards evening intelligence arrived, that
Rassburg also had been attacked with success,
and during the three or four succeeding
days similar tidings were received
from other parts of the country: Schwannau,
Kussnach, Zinguri (which was not
yet finished) and many other places of importance,
had been wrested from the
hands of Helvetia’s tyrants. Such universal
success testified, that the arm of the
Protector of innocence had fought in their
cause; and they thought, the best means
of showing their gratitude for such powerful
aid to him, who detests unnecessary
bloodshed, was to use their victory with
mildness and moderation. They had expelled
their enemies, and reinstated themselves
in their natural rights: more they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>sought not, more they desired not; and
it was this laudable moderation, which, by
preventing them from aiming to obtain
further advantages, enabled them to secure,
what they had won already.</p>

<p class='c018'>Peace after so long an absence returned
once more to these happy vallies; and a
firm fraternal union for offence and defence
was established, which I pray, that
God may grant to last, as long as the
world exists.</p>

<p class='c018'>Has not the ignorant Nun suffered herself
to be enticed out of her proper sphere,
while she described scenes of war and the
efforts of Liberty? She, a weak defenceless
woman, a slave bound in lasting fetters?
Yet Heaven be thanked for it,
those fetters are light: pious submission
enables me to bear them, and they will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>ere long be loosened by the hand of
Death.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Donat’s widow lived in tranquil
seclusion at Zurich in the society of the
Countess Urania; and their prayers were
frequently offered up for the success of the
honest Helvetians. They rejoiced to hear
of their victories, of Amalberga’s rescue,
and of her union with the Count of Torrenburg.
But Helen did not wish to be herself
a spectatress of their felicity; nor
(when shortly after their marriage the
happy pair visited her to express their
mutual gratitude) could she be prevailed
upon to pass more than one hour in their
society; and many, many of the succeeding
days were for her days of anguish.
Poor Helen was but a weak mortal, no
saint, no angel: and alas! to <i>forget</i> is a
task not so easy, as some may think!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Yet in recompence for her past sorrows
Heaven had still reserved one pleasure for
her future life. Oh! Blessed Virgin, what a
pleasure was that! what a surprise! what
an unexpected re-union!—But let me proceed
regularly.</p>

<p class='c018'>The good Domina of Zurich was dead;
the Princess Euphemia had already been
appointed Abbess of Tull, and therefore
could not accept the vacant dignity. No
persuasion could induce Urania, at her advanced
age, to fill so laborious a situation,
and the lot now fell upon Count Donat’s
widow. She obeyed the general voice,
and was well-pleased to have a means for
exerting benevolence in a more extended
circle. She became (what I say of her
ought not to be counted to her as a merit,
since she did but her duty) she became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the mother of the opprest; and the man,
who intrusted to her a daughter, a sister,
or a mistress, knew, that she could be no
where safer than in her arms. This was
universally known; and many a knight,
before he set out on some distant expedition,
secured under her protection those
treasures, which he valued dearer than all
others, which the world contained.</p>

<p class='c018'>One day a knight requested an audience
of her: as soon as she saw him, it
struck her, that his features were not altogether
unknown to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Sir Knight,” said she, “it appears
to me, that we have met before.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“You say truly, holy mother,”
answered he; “it was I, who by the
Bishop of Coira’s command took the Castle
of Sargans by storm, and afterwards conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>you to this Convent. Methinks,
you placed but little confidence in me on
that occasion, though perhaps it would
have been for your advantage, had you
shown more: but its true, you knew not
my name; knew not, that never had any
one reason to repent the trust, which he
reposed in Herman of Werdenberg. I
will not follow your example; I am now
preparing to reveal to you my dearest secrets,
and solicit you to become the
guardian of my most precious treasure.
Grief of heart some time ago drove me
from my native land: my uncle’s death
necessitated my return; and being once
more in Germany, I suffered myself to be
persuaded to remain there: nay, under a
borrowed name I consented to act as the
knight-protector of the new Bishop’s subjects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and to become the assertor of his
rights and privileges.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was in this capacity, that I became
acquainted with you, Lady, in the Castle
of Sargans: report, and mysterious circumstances
respecting your conduct, I
confess, had not prejudiced me in your favour;
and perhaps I did not treat you
with so much respect and attention, as (I
am now well convinced) was justly due to
your merits. After escorting you hither,
I returned to Sargans, being commissioned
to defend the Castle against Landenberg
and his associates, in the name of
Count Donat’s daughters; whom the Bishop
had adopted as his wards, and whom
he publicly declared his intention of reinstating
in their rights, as soon as the
place of their concealment could be ascertained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>It seems, the rebellious Landenberg
thought, that this was the fit time for
making himself master of all Rhœtia,
while the Ten Jurisdictions were torn to
pieces by the tumults and confusion, to
which his artifices had given rise; but report
must have already informed you,
how soon those vain hopes were crushed
by the noble efforts of the assertors of
Liberty.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In order that I might not be quite idle
during my undisturbed residence at Sargans,
the Bishop (who has no antipathy
to gold) commissioned me to enquire into
the truth of an old tradition very current
among the people, that immense treasures
lie buried in the foundation of that antient
fortress. Upon asking some questions,
I was conducted to an old and ruined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>well in a remote court, and assured
that it contained wealth inexhaustible.
The Bishop on this report desired me to
cause the well to be cleared out; but its
contents furnished nothing but venomous
reptiles, filth, and some human bones, the
melancholy memorials of former cruelties,
whose commission Heaven no doubt had
long since punished.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Other places were afterwards pointed
out to me as the repository of this buried
wealth; but no better success attended
their examination. At length I resolved
to set my workmen to clear out that subterraneous
passage, the falling-in of whose
roof had so nearly proved your destruction.
It seemed to me much more probable,
that I should find here that of which I was
in search, than in those places which I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>already examined; but it was my full determination,
in case of discovering the supposed
treasures, not to give them up to the
Bishop, but to reserve them for the heiress
of Carlsheim and Sargans, who had
lately been rescued from Landenberg’s
power, and was now Countess of Torrenburg.
It was however less my object to
find wealth which I despised, than to furnish
my followers with a harmless occupation,
and by restoring the concealed passage
(which in our turbulent times is absolutely
necessary in every fortress) to render
a trifling service to posterity. The
work was difficult and tedious; however,
I was just rejoicing in the reflection, that a
few days would suffice to finish it, when
the Bishop of Coira found it impossible to
delay any longer with common decency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the restoring of Sargans to the
Countess Amalberga and her husband.
One branch of the passage alone remained
in ruins, and I would gladly have completed
my task; but Count Eginhart was
already at the gates of Sargans. I hastened
to deliver up every thing, which had
been committed to my custody, and we
renewed our former friendship; a friendship,
which in the earlier part of our lives
had been most intimate.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was my intention to request his
permission to finish the repairs of the subterraneous
caverns: unluckily, as we sat
conversing together, and recalling the
events of former days over our flowing
goblets, he mentioned the sister of his
bride, who had once made upon my heart
a very forcible impression; but my passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>was not strong enough to make me
consent to commit my honour to the
keeping of a daughter of Count Donat.
The Count painted in glowing colours the
happiness, which he enjoyed with Amalberga;
and he finally accused me of having
treated the Lady Emmeline unworthily,
and of having driven her into the jaws
of perdition by my rigour and contempt.
As her relations have always wrapt in mystery
the latter scenes of Emmeline’s life,
I am even at this moment ignorant, as to
what is become of Her, who was once so
dear to me; nor could I understand, to
what the Count alluded in the conclusion
of his speech. I could not, however, allow,
that I had acted by her with injustice,
and asserted, with that warmth which
is natural to me, that no man of prudence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and honour would have acted otherwise.
Our conversation grew bitter; and at
length we parted in such anger, that it was
impossible for me to submit to asking of
him as a favour, that I might prosecute
my subterraneous labours.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Perhaps you will be surprised at my
being so anxious about such a trifle, as the
repairs of these vaults; I must therefore
confess to you, that the real motive of my
wish to examine this passage thoroughly,
was nothing more than a dream; but that
dream was in truth a very remarkable
one.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The first time that I broke a lance at
a public tournament, it was my fortune to
obtain the prize, a ring apparently of considerable
value. I was pleased both with the
jewel, and with the manner in which I obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>it, and never failed to wear it on
all solemn festivals; till a person well skilled
in precious stones convinced me, that
the diamond was false and the ring itself
scarcely worth three golden shields<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Incensed
at having been so grossly imposed
upon, I snatched it from my finger, and
threw it over the battlements: the circumstance
of its having been the reward
of my address soon made me wish to recover
it; but though my squire was immediately
dispatched, he returned without
having been able to find it. I had quite forgotten
this ring and all its circumstances;
but on both the two nights preceding Torrenburg’s
entry into the Castle of Sargans,
I dreamt, that in traversing the subterraneous
passage I found my lost ring, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that the false stone was changed into a diamond,
which illuminated the whole cavern
with its radiance.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A coin so called, from its bearing a shield imprest upon it.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>“I cannot account for the strong impression,
which this dream made upon
my fancy; yet (Heaven knows!) I set
but little store upon the treasures
of this world, and were I possest of
all the diamonds which the earth contains,
I should only employ them to adorn our
Redeemer’s cross; that cross, which it is
my firm resolution to wear in future
against the Saracens, and other enemies of
our holy religion. Yet in spite of this
contempt of wealth, and of the little faith
which I put in omens, the repetition of
this dream struck my imagination so forcibly,
that I could not rest without ascertaining,
whether the vaults did really contain
the ring, which I had so long lost.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“My disagreement with Torrenburg had
made it impossible for me to satisfy my
doubts by means of the Castle-entrance:
but I thought it by no means unlikely,
that there might be some communication
between the passage and the ruined Abbey
of Curwald, which was situated at no
great distance, and was just beginning to
be rebuilt.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was well acquainted with Father
John; a worthy man, who had lately been
appointed the Superior of those few
Monks, who had escaped from Count
Donat’s barbarity. He readily acceded to
my request, and I immediately began my
work.</p>

<p class='c018'>“For several days the ruins were examined
without success: yet the assurance
of one of the elder Monks, that he remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>having heard (but merely as a tradition)
that a private communication had
formerly existed between the Convent and
Sargans, made me unwilling to give up the
pursuit. It was frequently my custom
after dismissing my labourers (wearied
with their fruitless endeavours to discover
that, which they were firmly persuaded
had no existence) to wander by myself,
and mark the melancholy contrast made
by the slowly-rising walls of the new building,
with the ruins of the old one which
had not yet been removed. The vaults
beneath the Convent being generally the
scene of our enquiries, as affording us the
best chance for finding the so much wished-for
passage, I frequently loitered here
alone, after my workmen had left me for
the evening,  A fixed melancholy had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>taken possession of my soul: in truth, it
could not well be otherwise, surrounded as
I was on all sides by memorials of mortality,
and the marks of celestial judgments!</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Where,” said I often to myself,
“where are now the voluptuous pleasures
of the Monks of Curwald? where the
pride and power of the tyrants of Carlsheim
and Sargans? The grave has swallowed
them all; nothing remains of them,
but the memory of their crimes and the
detestation of posterity!—Herman, still
preserve in your heart unshaken the love
of virtue, and not less the hatred of vice:
be at once the terror of the profligate and
the friend of the innocent and the helpless.
Bring equally before the world’s eye
the rights of the opprest and the crimes
of the oppressor, and unite in one person
the protecting and the avenging angel.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“These ideas prest themselves upon my
mind with more than ordinary force, as I
sat one evening in one of the Convent-vaults
upon a heap of stones. It was in
the vault nearest to those of Sargans; and
despairing of finding the old secret communication,
I had at length resolved to
employ my workmen in digging out a
new one. They had already commenced
their labours, and were retired after making
no inconsiderable progress. The hour
was late; darkness had closed round me,
but an iron lamp was fixed against the
wall and guided my steps, as I slowly traversed
to and fro this abode of religious
melancholy. The scene was congenial to
the state of my feelings; I consecrated it
to secret sorrow; and here it was that I
offered up my prayers for the future, here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>it was that I poured forth my tears, while
dwelling upon the past. Yes, holy Mother,
my <i>tears</i>! The stern and haughty
Herman of Werdenberg has wept frequently;
has wept, when if any eye had
witnessed the drops, his cheek would have
blushed with shame at the unworthy cause
of his sorrow; to <i>you</i> alone, to the ear of
indulgent pity, he scruples not to disclose
the secret of his weakness.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Lady, my tears streamed for having
formed an early attachment for
one, who deserved not my affection. I
once adored Emmeline of Sargans; but I
tore her from my heart, convinced that it
was impossible for <i>her</i> to be virtuous, who
had been educated in the very lap of vice.
Yet Amalberga, Emmeline’s sister, and
who had been educated with her, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>modest, pure, and irreproachable; then
why not Emmeline? What had since
happened to that unfortunate was unknown
to me; and my disagreement with
her brother-in-law prevented my obtaining
that information from him, which I
was now most anxious to obtain; for one
of his expressions had cut me to the very
soul, and I strove in vain to banish it
from my memory. He told me,
“that my rigour had driven Emmeline
into the jaws of perdition;” and while his
words lay heavy upon my heart, I could
not but own, that it was possible for his
accusation to be well-founded. An union
with an honest man, such as Herman of
Werdenberg boasts himself to be, would
have been the best and most certain means
of rescuing her from the power of her licentious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>father and the contagion of his
example. Yet what could I do? Say,
that I was mistaken in my judgment of
Emmeline; still was it incumbent on me
to run so great a risque to preserve her, as
to entrust the care of my honour to one,
who I feared would prove a wanton?</p>

<p class='c018'>“But at all events, these considerations
came too late. Nothing was now left for me
but to banish recollections which, (Heaven
only knows, why) intruded themselves upon
me so forcibly, and which certainly were
the most absurd and fruitless, with which
I could have employed my mind. Yet still
they <i>did</i> employ it in spite of all my efforts,
as I sat with my eyes sometimes
fixed on the dark vaults which frowned
above me, sometimes on the glimmerings
of the distant lamp, without being conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>what it was, at which I was gazing.
At length incensed at my own folly I
started from my seat, and was quitting the
vault abruptly, when a faint murmur
struck my hearing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I stopped. It was not the first time,
that I had heard something like a groan,
while traversing these vaults; but I had
always supposed the noise to be occasioned
by the wind, or else to be the echo of
my own heart-drawn sighs. But now it
was not only more loud and more distinct,
but I almost fancied, that it was followed
by sounds resembling words spoken by
one in agony.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I hastened back to the place, which I
had just quitted. I shouted, to observe
whether an echo would answer me, but
all was silent.—I removed to a distance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>I came back again; I placed my head
against the wall of the cavern; I knelt,
and laid my ear to the ground; I heard
the noise again. I endeavoured to trace
it; still it continued, sometimes louder,
sometimes weaker; till at length it conducted
me to a small iron grating inserted
in the ground, and from whence the wind,
which blew upon me, seemed to be more
heavy and chilling, than that which I
breathed in the vaults above.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And through this opening did a voice
now reach me, whose melancholy tones
seemed those of a female! It sounded so
audibly, that all my doubts vanished at
once, and all my sensations resolved themselves
into the single eager enquiry—‘By
what means I could assist the sufferer?’—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Are you then come at last?” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the voice; “but speak louder,
for I cannot understand what you say!—My
senses are so confused ... and my
brain seems to whirl round and round so
rapidly!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I repeated my enquiries, but with no
better effect.”</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I hear the sound of your voice, but
not your words,” answered the captive;
“and weakness prevents my dragging myself
nearer to the grate—Do you bring me
food?—Alas! it is so long since you last
visited me!—I was afraid, that you had
died suddenly—Afraid, did I say?—Oh!
Heaven, who would have suspected, that
I should ever have dreaded Luprian’s
death!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“These words were pronounced slowly,
and in broken sentences. I now stretched
my voice to its utmost extent, and dwelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>with peculiar emphasis on the words
“Help” and “Liberty.”</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Liberty?” she repeated; “no,
Luprian; at your price it would be too
dearly purchased. Urge me no more to
be the partner of your flight: could I
have ever stooped to disgrace, I need not
have languished so long in this dreary
dungeon. If I have no choice left but
death or infamy, I prefer the former;
leave me, and let me die!—And yet....
Oh! God in Heaven! To part with even
the most miserable existence is so bitter....
Oh! it is still so bitter!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I saw, that it would be vain for me to
labour any more at making myself understood;
and the faint tone, in which these
last words were uttered, alarmed me. Yet
I spoke once again, but no answer was returned;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>I doubted not, that the unfortunate
had fainted.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How I might effect her delivery with
the utmost celerity, I knew not; yet in
my anguish and uncertainty I accidentally
struck upon that, which was most prudent:
I hastened to the small temporary
building inhabited by Abbot John and his
Monks; I related in a few words what had
happened, and requested their advice.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Fraternity one and all hastened
with me to the vault, every one bearing a
mattock, a pick-axe, or some such instrument.
They were holy benevolent men,
resembling the original founders of their
Order, and had escaped as it were by a
miracle from the flames, in which their
guilty brethren had perished. They were
eager to redeem by their own conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the slur, which the crimes of others had
brought upon their Convent, and were as
greedy of good actions, as most other
Monks are of rich legacies and well-stored
cellars.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We were now near the vault, and already
the beams of the distant lamp struck
our eyes; but on our entrance, those
among us who were best-sighted were
aware, that the vault was not so totally
unoccupied, as I had left it. By the glimmerings
of a small lanthorn a tall dark
figure was descried, kneeling on the before-mentioned
grating. I sprang forward.
The stranger heard my steps,
started from the ground, and rushed by
me so suddenly, that I attempted to stop
him in vain. I called to the approaching
Monks not to let him pass; but before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>they could reach him, his foot stumbled,
and he fell prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Totally engrossed by their impatience
to rescue the prisoner, my companions
were hastening forwards without paying
any attention to the stranger; but a
thought, which passed through my mind
like a flash of light, made me conceive,
how important it was to examine him. I
flattered myself, that I should discover in
him that same Luprian, whom the unfortunate
had mentioned, and who in all probability
was her gaoler. Should my conjecture
prove correct, I considered this
meeting as a great step towards her deliverance:
I therefore grasped him firmly
by the arm, and dragged him towards the
lamp, in order that I might examine my
prize.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“I beheld a miserable creature, enveloped
in the ragged habit of a monk, and
whose bloodless cheeks, sunk eyes, and
emaciated limbs would have excited my
deepest compassion, had I not had good
cause to harbour suspicions, that compassion
was a sentiment, of which he was
but little deserving.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Art thou Luprian?” said I in a
thundering voice.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He sank at my feet, and stammered
out an avowal.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Wretch!” I continued; “what
motive could induce thee to confine an
unfortunate woman in yonder subterraneous
dungeon?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“He was silent for a few moments;
then suddenly starting from the ground—“You
know that she <i>is</i> confined there,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>said he with a furious look, “and knowing
that, you know enough to destroy
me! Ask me no more questions; I will
answer none!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“He threw himself sullenly upon the
heap of ruins, and maintained an obstinate
silence. Unwilling to own that I knew
no more than his name, I first endeavoured
to terrify him into a disclosure of this
mystery; and finding my threats produce
no effect, I had recourse to persuasion,
painting in as strong colours as possible
the cruelty of suffering the unfortunate to
remain longer in her prison, and exhorting
him to atone in some degree for his
faults towards his captive, by being himself
the instrument to effect her release.
In the mean while my companions had
fallen to work with their spades and mattocks;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>but large pieces of stone frequently
fell into the dungeon below; and the
cries of the sufferer, who dreaded being
crushed beneath their weight, convinced
them, how dangerous was this mode of
procuring her deliverance, and finally compelled
them to desist from the attempt.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What was now to be done? While
we agitated this question, Luprian stood
with his arms folded, silent and thoughtful,
as if He too had been resolving some
difficult point; at length he threw himself
on his knees before us; and on condition
that his life and liberty should be secured
to him, he made a proposal, which he
swore to fulfil conscientiously.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“No one but myself,” said he, “can
enable you to set that captive free, and it
is in my power to show you such means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>as are most sure and speedy. You see
how rotten is this vault, and you may
judge from the faint murmur of her complaints,
how deep her dungeon is sunk
into the ground. It will at any rate be
long, ere you can force your way to her;
and from her extreme weakness it is unlikely,
that she should live till your arrival,
even should she escape the imminent danger
of having her brains dashed out by
some fragment of the crumbling roof.
But only speak one word to assure me of
life and forgiveness, and I will immediately
furnish you with explanations, which
(should you refuse my offer) this dagger
shall enable me to take with me to the
grave.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The naked steel, which Luprian now
pointed towards his bosom, inspired us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>with no alarm. It would have been easy
to wrest the weapon from his grasp; but
our impatience to assist the unfortunate
captive compelled us to give the required
promise. Her complaints had now again
ceased to be audible; and we felt, that
not a moment was to be lost, if we meant
to find her still in existence.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As soon as we had solemnly engaged
not to attempt either his life or freedom,
Luprian resigned his dagger to one of the
Monks, and informed us, that in order
to accomplish our object it would be necessary
to quit the vault, and seek a different
entrance to the lady’s dungeon,
which was well known to him. Accordingly
we followed him for some time, till
we arrived at a remote part of the Convent
ruins.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>—“Here,” said he, stopping before a
ruined wall, from which he removed a
few loose stones, and showed us a narrow
flight of stairs; “here you must descend,
and these steps will conduct you to the
place, of which you are in search. Now
then I have performed my promise, and
require the performance of yours: permit
me to retire.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I hastily seized a torch from one of
the Monks, and was hastening down the
staircase, without giving myself a moment’s
reflection: but the more prudent
Abbot detained me, gave the torch to Luprian,
and commanded him to finish the
work which he had begun, before he
claimed the reward of his services.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nothing was left for him but to obey.
He guided us down about fifty steps, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>after reaching the foot of the stairs we had
a subterraneous passage to traverse of the
same length with that, which had led us
from the grating to the ruined wall. It
was terminated by an iron door strongly
fastened on the outside, and which had we
not detained Luprian, we should have
found no little difficulty, and lost no little
time, in opening. As I made this observation,
I cast upon him an accusing glance;
but the door unclosing left me no time to
express in words my indignation at this
proof of his intended treachery. We
rushed eagerly into the dungeon, and
found it to be a large vaulted cell, of which
darkness had taken such complete possession,
that the beams of our torches
were insufficient to dissipate the gloom,
and could only shed a faint glimmering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>around us. Its only recommendations
were its loftiness and space. By holding
our lights on high, we could discern (but
with difficulty) the iron grating inserted
in the roof, through which the complaints
of the prisoner had so seasonably reached
me. Exactly beneath it stood a loaf and
a flask of wine, which Luprian had just let
down into the dungeon; and in a corner
of it stretched on a miserable pallet the object
of our search lay fainting, as indeed
we had suspected from her silence. With
the assistance of one of the younger
Monks I raised her from the ground, and
bore her to the upper air, which we considered
as the most likely means of bringing
her to herself.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This hope however proved vain. Animation
was lost too completely to be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>easily recalled. Above an hour had
elapsed since our conveying her to the
Abbot’s dwelling (where no means were
neglected that could restore animation)
before we had the least reason to flatter
ourselves with hopes of her recovery. At
length with inexpressible delight we saw
her half unclose her eyes; but she instantly
shut them again on account of the
pain caused in them by the light, to which
they were now quite unaccustomed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We gave her every possible assistance,
and after some time she gained strength
and recollection enough to enable her to
comprehend the favourable change, which
had taken place in her situation. Tears
of joy, and her clasped hands raised in
gratitude to Heaven, were her only answer.
She strove to thank us for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>service which we had rendered her; but
emotion choaked her utterance, and to
express her sense of our kindness by looks
was not in her power, since the beams of
the sun (who was now risen) were so painful
to her eyes, that she had been obliged
to cover her face with a thick veil to save
herself from relapsing into insensibility.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We therefore carefully excluded day-light
from her chamber, and left her to
repose. While she slept, we resolved to
take the opportunity of making Luprian
explain a business, which we conceived to
be of some importance, and respecting
which our curiosity was raised to the
highest pitch by hearing some of the
Monks assert their persuasion, that Luprian’s
features were not unknown to
them. The last Abbot of Curwald, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>was supposed to have perished in the conflagration,
had borne that name, and in
spite of his pale countenance and meagre
form they verily believed my prisoner to
be no other. We were now all impatience
to ascertain this point; but we found,
that in order to effect our object we ought
to have been more upon our guard. Occupied
by the melancholy situation of the
lady, which excited universal interest and
compassion, not one of us had paid the
least attention to her gaoler: now that we
recollected him, he was not to be found.
It appeared probable, that he had forsaken
us immediately upon our entrance into
the subterraneous dungeon, since no one
remembered to have seen him since that
time, nor indeed to have bestowed a
thought upon him. We had now nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>left for it but to rail at our inattention,
and to lay the blame upon each other.
However, we did not think our loss of
any material consequence, since we doubted
not the lady’s ability to clear up the
mystery; and at all events the captive
was at liberty, and we had effected a good
deed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She awoke, greatly strengthened by
her refreshing slumber: her first request
was to be removed from the society of
men, and committed to the charge of persons
of her own sex. We had already
agreed with a respectable widow in one of
the neighbouring villages, that the invalid
should be taken to her house, as soon as
she was able to bear the removal. The
good woman soon made her appearance,
and the stranger’s impatience to quit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Monastery was so extreme, that we judged
her likely to suffer less detriment from the
journey than from delay. The distance
was not great; she was placed in an easy
litter; and her nurse took such good care
of her both during her removal and afterwards,
that she was quickly pronounced
out of all danger. Her eyes again became
accustomed to day-light; her hearing was
no longer hurt by the loudness of human
voices, and she could speak without difficulty:
yet has she never thought proper
to disclose her name either to myself, or to
the Abbot who visited her daily.—But let
it still remain concealed; there is at least
<i>one</i> title, which after hearing the brief relation
of her sufferings I know well to be
her proper right; the title of the purest
and most heroic of virtuous martyrs, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>name which deserves to be engraved on
marble, and employed to add sanctity to
altars!</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are surprised, holy Lady, to hear
the cold and serious Herman speak with
such enthusiasm; but let it not injure me
in your opinion. The rescued prisoner
perhaps was once beautiful, but now she
is so no longer. Sorrow and confinement
have robbed her person of every charm,
which could inspire the voluptuary’s heart
with passion: yet were I ever to love
again, my soul should be devoted to the
perfection of female virtue, not of female
loveliness. Emmeline, the enchanting
Emmeline, with all her train of charms
and graces, perhaps, I may in time cease to
remember; but never, oh! never shall I
forget the form of my pale emaciated captive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>sinking into the grave the victim of
her principles; never while he has breath,
shall that interesting countenance fade
from the recollection of Herman of Werdenberg!</p>

<p class='c018'>“But I have wandered widely from the
object of this long discourse; I came hither
to make a request, to which all that
I have said is but an introduction: the
health of this noble persecuted creature,
of my friend, my sister, my preserved
one, is now almost re-established. She begins
to consider, what it will hereafter be
most expedient for her to do; and as she
says, that she has no relation in the world
to whom she dares confide her interests,
she has condescended to ask my advice respecting
her future proceedings. We both
agreed, that a convent is the most proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>retreat for her in her present circumstances;
and on my mentioning to her
that, which is under your direction, holy
Mother, she received the proposal with
rapture.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! surely,” she exclaimed, “my
mind cannot yet be quite itself again, or I
could not have hesitated a moment respecting
my choice.—Helen of Homburg!—the
Convent of Zurich!—Heavenly
powers, how could I have forgotten those
dear dear names so long?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“She then enquired eagerly, whether
Urania Venosta still lived within these
walls; and when I answered in the affirmative,
she discovered such strong emotion,
as her gentle despondent manners had
little led me to expect her being capable
of feeling. She clasped her hands in ecstacy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>a shower of tears rolled down her
pale cheeks, while she sank on her knees,
and returned thanks to Heaven; she then
entreated me to leave her without delay,
and prepare a reception for her in your
Convent. I would willingly have first ascertained,
whether she was already known
to you; but her impatience would not
admit of my postponing my journey for
an instant, and I was compelled to depart
unsatisfied.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now then may I hope, that my request
will not be rejected? Shall I be authorised
to assure my friend of a welcome reception
within these walls? Speak but one gracious
word, and a few hours will be sufficient
to bring her to your feet. Conducted
by the good Abbot she has followed
my steps hither, and I need only your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>permission to deliver her up to your protection,”—</p>

<p class='c018'>It is superfluous to say, that Herman’s
request was granted with readiness; but
how great was the emotion, which his narrative
had excited in his auditress, how
ardent her impatience for the arrival of the
unhappy lady! She was unable to restrain
her tears, and a thousand joyful exclamations
escaped her lips, whose import
was unintelligible to Herman.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Am I right,” said he, “in supposing,
that my friend is not unknown to
you?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Heaven grant, that it may prove
so,” answered the Abbess, while she hastily
wiped away her tears. “But as yet you
have allowed me so little insight into her
history, that I scarcely dare give credit to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>my hopes. Oh! furnish me with more
light; tell me every thing that you know
about her; and prevent my nourishing the
sweet but deceitful dreams, which now occupy
my fancy. Alas! alas! it is impossible
that they should be verified; in pity
then destroy them at once, before these
fond hopes have time to take such root in
my heart, that to tear them out again
would almost break it.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“All that I know respecting this
stranger,” answered Herman, “is, that
she was immured by her friends in the
Convent of St. Roswitha several months
before the fatal conflagration. It was not
long, before she became acquainted with
the manners, which prevailed in this polluted
Sanctuary. Luprian, the unworthy
Abbot of Curwald, who even under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>protecting roof of her father had insulted
her by a declaration of his passion, renewed
his persecution with increased ardour
in a place, which was completely under
his dominion. Much time was not
suffered to elapse, before her resistance
was punished by confinement in the cell,
whence I released her: yet she was occasionally
compelled to return to the Convent,
in order that her virtue might be assailed
by art, flattery, and every power of
the most refined seduction, as well as by
severity and persecution.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The day preceding the dreadful night,
in which these dwellings of sin were purified
by fire, had witnessed such a scene
of temptation, as Luprian thought could
not possibly fail of success. But it was
defeated in a manner so disgraceful for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>the enemies of innocence, that spite and
fury took the place of seduction and love.
The heroine was compelled to endure a variety
of the most cruel insults and injuries,
and then was dragged back to her dungeon
so exhausted with her sufferings,
that she could scarcely be called alive.</p>

<p class='c018'>“To her return to this prison was she
indebted for existence. It was sunk so
deep within the earth and so remote from
the inhabited parts of the Convent, that
she only had a slight suspicion from different
circumstances, that something unusual
was passing above her head. She
was confirmed in this idea by several days
elapsing without any nourishment being
brought to her. She was reduced to the
greatest extremity; and hunger would
soon have put a period to her sufferings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>when the prison-door was unlocked, and
the Abbot entered. A cordial of great
power, which he gave her, restored her
strength sufficiently to enable her at length
to comprehend the object of his visit. He
first informed her of the events which had
lately taken place, and then proceeded to
propose to her the terms, on which she
might obtain her liberty.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“It is universally believed,” said he,
“that I, as well as the rest of my Order,
have fallen a prey to the flames; I encourage
this opinion, since it enables me with
security to quit a profession, for which I
am ill calculated, and which I have always
held in detestation. I acknowledge it, my
passion for you has hitherto been such, as
you ought not to have complied with;
but I now come to declare sentiments so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>pure, that you may safely listen to them
without doing the least injury to your
honour. I have rescued the Abbey-treasure
from the ruins; I have also secured
such considerable funds in other countries,
as will enable me to support the establishment
of a temporal prince in any place
which you may prefer, provided it be one
where my person is not known. Nothing
is wanting to complete my happiness, except
the possession of your hand, and I
trust, you will not be so blind to your own
advantage, as to reject my honourable
suit. But one choice is allowed you;
either you must perish in this dungeon,
whose existence is now a secret to every
human being except myself; or else you
must take a solemn oath upon the cross to
share my flight from Germany, and become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span> my wife, as soon as we are safe in
some foreign climate. There is no time
for deliberation; the success of my plans
depends upon their speedy execution, and
you must instantly and at once pronounce
the sentence, which decides both <i>your</i> fate
and my own.—I wait your answer.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“That answer was such, as might have
been expected from one, by whom the licentious
Luprian was held in as much abhorrence,
as virtue was held dear and idolized.
She asserted the indissoluble nature
of his vows to religion, and repaid his
tender speeches with such scorn, that he
left her with a threat never to repeat his
offer, but to suffer her to perish of hunger
without compassion or remorse. But the
captive was too dear to him to permit his
keeping that resolution.  He tormented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>her with frequent visits, and desisted not
from his fruitless endeavours to reconcile
her to his plans; though to her great satisfaction
he was latterly compelled to abstain
from entering her dungeon. A suspicion
existed, that considerable treasures
were buried among the ruins of the Monastery;
it was therefore judged prudent
to place sentinels about them, and thus
was the execrable Monk debarred all intercourse
with his prisoner, except such as
could be carried on by favour of the iron
grating.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Luprian now found it absolutely necessary
for him to visit Italy, where he
had deposited the chief part of his wealth.
He entrusted the care of the lady to his sole
Confident. As his absence was protracted
longer than he had himself expected, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>enjoyed some respite from his infamous
addresses, and was not without hopes,
that her entreaties and sufferings would at
last induce his representative to take some
steps towards effecting her deliverance.
Those hopes however were continually disappointed.
His heart was not more flexible
than his associate’s; he remained immutably
faithful to the trust reposed in
him; and in answer to her enquiries respecting
the transactions of the regions
above her, he gave her such accounts of the
successes of her enemies and of the destruction
of all those who were dear to her, as
almost extinguished her anxiety to escape
from her dungeon. She saw, that nothing
but sorrow would welcome her return to
liberty, and the natural love of life struggled
but faintly against the certainty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>present sufferings, and the apprehension
of those, which were still to come.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Day after day crept away, during
which the dreadful uniformity of her unhappy
situation was uninterrupted, except
by moments of utter despair, whose
power frequently was on the point of subduing
the poor prisoner; or else by those
gleams of ungrounded hope, with which
Providence strengthens and comforts those
whom he means finally to preserve, in order
that they may not quite sink beneath
the burthen of their calamities. Luprian
still returned not: the lady’s complaints
seemed gradually to make their impression
on the mind of his deputy. He occasionally
suffered hints to escape him, that it
would not be impossible to obtain his consent
to her liberty: and at length at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>earnest request he was induced to declare,
that he was ready that instant to put an
end to her sufferings, provided she would
consent to share with him as his wife the
enjoyment of that wealth, which the Abbot
had placed in his custody.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Here then her hopes again were disappointed.
Vexation added bitterness to
the manner, in which she indignantly rejected
his infamous proposal: and the
wretch, exasperated by her cutting expressions,
swore, that he would put his
plan in execution without her that very
day, and would leave her to her fate. He
kept his oath; and the captive must have
perished, had not the Abbot fortunately
returned at this identical moment. His
expedition had been attended with nothing
but disappointment. The wealth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>which he had vested in foreign hands, had
disappeared from a variety of causes, some
through mischance, more through treachery;
and he now only returned to find
his associate fled, his treasure plundered,
and his mistress as inflexible as ever. Vexation,
poverty, and fatigue threw him on
the bed of sickness. Many days frequently
past, during which the captive was totally
neglected; when at length her gaoler
appeared, it was only to throw to her a
loaf of that bread, of which he now could
with difficulty procure a sufficiency for
his own sustenance, and with every time
to assure her, that this nourishment was
the last, which she would ever receive
from his hands. He spoke no longer of
flight, or indeed of his passion for her; in
truth, the former now seemed to be almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>impracticable, for the rebuilding of
the Monastery was begun; people were
constantly employed in the neighbourhood
of the dungeon’s entrance; and the outlets
from the ruins were watched with
more vigilance than ever. The sufferer
frequently entreated him to promise, that
he would at least reveal to some one the
place of her confinement before his death;
since in order to increase her terrors he
never mist an opportunity of assuring her,
that he had not many days to exist. But
in vain did she represent to him, that
when he should be in another world, her
sufferings in this could by no means be to
him of any advantage: he was deaf to her
supplications. Bitter and contemptuous
irony was his only answer; and it seemed
as if he solely enabled her to support life, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>order that he might still have a human being
in his power to torment.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was about this time, that the vaults
above her prison became an object of examination:
they were completely clogged
up with rubbish, except one narrow passage
conducting to the grate. She had
often determined on ending her sufferings
by a voluntary death, and for several days
persisted in refusing sustenance; but now
that she frequently heard a noise above
her head, and even once or twice caught
the gleam of distant torches through the
iron opening, her fearful resolutions were
laid aside, and their place occupied by the
hope, that accident perhaps might effect
her deliverance.</p>

<p class='c018'>“These hopes she concealed most sedulously
from her tyrant; and so often had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>her sweetest dreams disappointed her, that
despair still was able at times to regain his
former influence over her mind. Yet she
was now so accustomed to mark by some
piteous sound, that there was a suffering
creature buried in these caverns who implored
assistance, that she continued her
groans and cries, even when she had long
given up the expectation of their reaching
the ear of compassion. In truth, the
workmen, during the intervals of their labours,
had caught the faint murmurs of
her complaints; but they put no other interpretations
upon the sound, than such
as were suggested by terror and superstition.
Fortunately our enterprise necessarily
brought us every day nearer the place
of her seclusion; till at length some good
Angel made me attentive to the cry of sorrow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and guided me to the performance
of an action, which I shall never cease to
consider as the most blessed and fortunate
event of my whole life.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Herman of Werdenberg here ended his
long narrative; the emotions which it had
produced in Helen were so violent, that
every similitude would fall short of expressing
their strength.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Emmeline!” said she in that internal
voice, which is only audible to the
soul, “thou liv’st then, and I shall once
more clasp to my bosom the poor forlorn
orphan, the persecuted dove, the pious
martyr of chastity and religion!—And
Herman is your deliverer! that very
Herman of Werdenberg, who once was
unjust to your merits, and who now (if I
may judge by every possible evidence)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>adores you with the warmest, purest affection,
ever kindled in the bosom of a
mortal! Oh! Helen, Helen, what unexpected
joy! You will see two of the best
of human beings made happy after long
and cruel sufferings, and will yourself assist
in forwarding their happiness! My
own plans of worldly bliss have all been
ruined; in reward for my not murmuring
at their destruction, grant me, ye
powers of mercy, that wisdom and that
foresight, which may enable me to establish
the felicity of my friend on the firmest
foundations and with the least delay.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Herman was at a loss to comprehend
the long silence of the Abbess, and the
deep meditation, into which his narrative
seemed to have plunged her. At length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>she recollected herself, and at her request
he retired in search of the stranger, Helen
having previously stipulated that he should
not be present at their meeting. She was
not certain, that in the first moments of
emotion she should be sufficiently mistress
of herself to conceal Emmeline’s name;
and from what he had said, she collected,
that it was not her friend’s intention at
present to discover herself to her deliverer.</p>

<p class='c018'>A few hours elapsed, before Emmeline
appeared leaning on the good Abbot:
Helen now was no longer surprised, that
in her present situation she had not been
recognized by her former lover. She was
sadly, sadly changed. It was necessary to
have been quite as lovely as Emmeline, in
order not to have lost every charm of person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>during the long and cruel period of
her captivity; it was necessary to have
possest as wonderful a strength of mind
as hers, in order to escape with her senses
unimpaired from the fearful shipwreck of
all that was then most dear to her. Ah!
Herman, Herman! that youthful vivacity,
which appeared to you so high a crime,
and for which you so unjustly blamed the
innocent girl, was now fled for ever; its
place was supplied by a mild and serious
look of resignation, whose melancholy it’s
true was sometimes illumined by a benevolent
smile; but the smile was but momentary,
and its lustre soon faded away.
Yet thus it was, that you wished her to be;
and thus must Emmeline needs appear to
you a thousand times more pleasing, than
while she yet shone with all the brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>powers of unfaded youth, vivacity, and
beauty. Beautiful in truth was Emmeline
no more; but Emmeline was still interesting
beyond expression. A slight frail
nymph-like form, so light that it seemed
as if air could have sustained her; a face,
robbed of its roseate colour, but so dazzling
fair, that she resembled a marble
statue; a countenance, from which a
painter might have formed a portrait of
Christian Humility, and to which the consciousness
of heroic self-denial and of long
abstraction from all earthly hopes and
pleasures, had given a saint-like expression
that was almost supernatural; such now
was the once brilliant Emmeline of Sargans!</p>

<p class='c018'>But Helen did not make these observations
during the first moments of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>meeting; she could attend to nothing but
the joy of once more embracing her persecuted
friend, whom she prest to her bosom
with pleasure too great for utterance.
Emmeline was more composed; it was
long since she had seen Helen, who had
never been to her more than a beloved
play-fellow, whom she sometimes remembered
with a wish to meet again, and
sometimes quite forgot in contemplation
of nearer interests and impending dangers:
but much more was she to Helen. The
sufferings of amiable persons, with whom
we have ever had even the slightest acquaintance,
give them an extraordinary
value in our eyes; and they inspire us
with an affection for them which rises to
the highest pitch, if we feel that it is at
all in our power to show them kindness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>and to repair in some degree the past injustice
of their fate.</p>

<p class='c018'>What happened at this interview between
the re-united friends; with what
rapture Emmeline was received by the infirm
Urania, whose life was now drawing
towards its close; the recapitulation of
what had past during their separation,
and the plans which they arranged for the
future; all this I shall pass over in silence,
and shall only relate so much of the latter,
as may be absolutely necessary. Time and
grief had made alterations in Herman’s appearance
scarcely less surprising than in
Emmeline’s. His assumed name; his
gentle manners softened by melancholy
recollections and by compassion for the invalid,
so different from the sternness and
contempt with which he had ever treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>her at the Bishop’s court; the dimness of
her still-enfeebled sight; the darkened
chamber, whose half-light only afforded
her an indistinct view of her deliverer,
when he visited her; these circumstances
had contributed to conceal Herman from
her knowledge, and she only entertained
a suspicion, that the sound of his voice
was not totally unknown to her. But she
remarked his growing affection; and being
unwilling to encourage it, she abstained
from making those enquiries, which
might perhaps have satisfied her curiosity,
but which also might have led him to believe,
that she was interested respecting
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was perfectly ignorant of all, that had
passed during her captivity. She had
given her gaoler’s assertions implicit credit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and firmly believed, that the few persons
whom she loved were numbered
among the dead.—With what joy did she
hear from Helen’s lips the assurance, that
Amalberga was alive and happy, and that
she herself was indebted for her release to
no other than Herman of Werdenberg!—In
truth, she had hitherto been resolved
to discourage the attachment of this unknown
warrior; but this resolution only
lasted, till she discovered his real name.
Present gratitude and former affection
now gave him a double interest in her
heart: yet did it not so totally overpower
all other feelings, as to determine her to
forget entirely the injustice of his former
conduct. She was resolved to put him to
a severe trial; she was besides not quite
certain, that his ancient prejudices might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>not still have some influence over him;
but a few conversations with the Knight
were sufficient to efface every suspicion on
this subject. He frequently visited his
unknown mistress at the Convent-grate,
where (the better to elude a discovery)
she never appeared without a veil: with
every visit his attachment evidently increased
in strength; yet even in her presence
he frequently bestowed a sigh upon
the rejected Emmeline, whom he never
mentioned but in terms of interest and
compassion. This conduct was not without
its advantage, and when he was soon
after compelled to fulfill his vow of assisting
in the crusade against the infidel Albigese,
he did not depart without hopes of
being welcome at his return.</p>

<p class='c018'>During his absence the meeting took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>place between Emmeline and her beloved
sister. Helen had at length gained such
perfect mastery over her feelings, as to endure
without agony the presence of Torrenburg
and the happy Amalberga; and
she and Urania were the delighted witnesses
of a scene, which appeared rather
calculated for the regions of light beyond
the grave, than for the habitation of
wretched mortality. Amalberga, clasped
in the arms of that sister, whom she had so
long numbered with the dead; Torrenburg,
Urania, and Helen, the spectators
of and the partners in their joy; and then
the relation of Emmeline’s cruel sufferings;
and then the description of Amalberga’s
unclouded happiness; and then
the brilliant prospects for the future which
displayed themselves to both, and which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>for <i>this</i> time were no illusions.... No, I
will not trust my feeble pen with the description!</p>

<p class='c018'>The report soon circulated through the
country, that the lost daughter of Count
Donat was still in existence. The sisters
shared the inheritance amicably, like two
lovers dividing some scarce and delicious
fruit, each anxious that the other should
receive a full proportion. From every
quarter of the free and happy Helvetia
thronged the ancient friends of the family
of Sargans to congratulate the co-heiresses.
At length came also Herman of Werdenberg
in quest of his unknown mistress,
whom he understood to be resident at
Sargans; he returned from his expedition,
crowned with glory, and rewarded by the
Pope with absolution from his sins; a favour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of which the pious warrior stood but
little in need. Count Torrenburg proffered
him the hand of his sister, of the
rich heiress of Sargans, of her whose
beauty had formerly fascinated his eyes;
but his heart was now possest by the poor
and friendless stranger, and the hand of
the rich heiress was respectfully declined.
Indignation at this refusal was the reason
assigned by Amalberga for the non-appearance
of her sister; the stranger however
was not equally invisible, though her veil
was not yet laid aside; and her consent
to become his bride soon repaid him for
his constancy. It was not till the espousals
had taken place, that she revealed to
him her real name, which Herman now
grown wiser heard without repugnance;
for his early prejudices had at length lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>their influence in his bosom, and Emmeline’s
past sufferings left him no doubt respecting
the purity of her future conduct.
He believed, that he had plighted his
faith to a needy friendless orphan; and
the orphan in giving him her hand made
him the powerful Lord of Upper-Carlsheim,
of Ortenstein, and of many other
fruitful territories. Happy were their
days; happy was she through him, and
he through her! He had found once
more the long-lost jewel, of whose value
he was so long unconscious; he had found
the attachments of his early youth and of
his maturer manhood, the choice both of
his heart and of his head, and had found
them all united in the person of his adored
Emmeline!</p>

<p class='c018'>And Helen was the spectatress of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>felicity, nay is so still at the moment that
I trace these lines! Dear as they were to
her, so dear to her are still the sisters and
their worthy husbands!—Lo! how in this
world every thing passes away; God be
thanked for it, even our passions pass
away, as well as the rest. Tranquil age
succeeds the impetuosity and hurry of
youth; the summer, whose every day
was disturbed by tempests, is replaced by
the mild and mellow autumn.—Much as it
had suffered, bitter as had been its disappointments,
cruel as had been its sacrifices,
even the heart of Helen at length was at
rest.</p>

<p class='c018'>All my friends still flourish; all who
are dear to me still live, even the venerable
Urania. My native land smiles all
around in blessed peace; not one of those,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>who are near to my heart, has as yet been
obliged to pay with his blood the price of
precious Freedom! Guilt begins to be a
stranger among our citizens; the dwellings
of luxury and indolence are converted
into sanctuaries of virtue and religion.
The Monastery of Curwald has risen from
its ashes with increased lustre; no Luprian,
no Guiderius now rules there over
proud voluptuous Monks; no sisters of
Love<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a> now inhabit the cells of the neighbouring
Convent. The good Abbot John
has admitted into his fraternity none but
such men, as look on vice with no less detestation
than himself; and their holy conduct
has completely removed the stigma,
which the remembrance of their abandoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>predecessors had fixed upon the whole
brotherhood of Cloister-Curwald.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>In the subterraneous vaults of Sargans
has Herman lately raised a splendid monument
sacred to the sufferings of his wife.
Thirty silver lamps blaze before it; an
easy and unguarded entrance admits every
one, who chooses to approach it; and
there does many a pilgrim often loiter to
hear with pious admiration the history of
a still living saint.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amalberga was desirous of opening the
communication between the vaulted caverns
and the south-western mountains,
where the fugitive Monks established their
hermitage: but hitherto all attempts to
discover the outlet have been unsuccessful.
The old Gertrude is no more; the
Countess Urania’s age and infirmity forbids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>her visiting the Castle; and the directions,
which her memory could furnish,
are rendered of no avail, the
vaults being completely altered in appearance
by the falling-in of the roof. Researches
made on the outside of the mountain
have been equally fruitless, nor has
even the Hermitage itself been discovered.
Probably the holy Society has been dissolved
by death: Fame will not hand
down their good works to the admiration
of after-ages, but that is of but little consequence;
they stand inscribed in letters
of flame in the book of the Everlasting!</p>

    <div class='c000'>[CONTINUED.]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c021'><i>Elizabeth, Countess of Torrenburg, to Count Oswald of March.</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>By this, my dear brother, you must be
as well informed of the history of the Ladies
of Sargans, as myself; I am impatient
to know your opinion of these papers, and
whether the effect which they have produced
upon <i>your</i> mind is as strong, as that
which during their perusal I experienced
upon my own.—Yet that is impossible;
my peculiar situation makes these annals
inexpressibly interesting to me; and did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>not the parchments, from which I have
copied them, bear unequivocal marks of
their antiquity, I should suspect their having
been written for the purpose of being
laid before me. While I read, I was half
tempted to believe, that the good old Abbot,
who recommended them to my notice,
had inserted all those passages, which apply
so well to my own situation, in order to
lead me unconsciously to the point, where
he has been labouring to place me; and if
this were the fact, how would he triumph
in the success of his design! But the circumstances
of these memoirs are alas! but
too authentic; as to their antiquity I
have such proofs of it, that I would boldly
match them against the title-deeds of
my domains, and other old documents
of that period, at which these annals
are stated to have been composed.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Nevertheless, feeling it to be of no
slight importance to me to know, whether
what I had read was authentic or a mere
fabrication, I spared no pains to ascertain
the fact. You are aware, that I became
possest of these writings by little better
than a piece of theft; and in truth there
may be good reasons for not communicating
to one of the laity these papers, which
contain such frightful memorials of ecclesiastical
guilt.—I could not therefore attack
the Abbess on the subject directly;
but as in hopes of pacifying me for my
disappointment she had proposed to relate
such particulars respecting the Ladies of
Sargans, as were most worthy of my attention,
(an offer, which I at first rejected
out of obstinacy, and through vexation at
the denial of my request) I now summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>her to perform her promise, for
the purpose of comparing what I should
hear from her with the particulars contained
in the stolen parchments.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Abbess bestowed upon me a few
hours every day in that closet, where the
portraits of the Ladies of Sargans had first
attracted my attention to those models of
virtue and patient suffering: her account
of them did not greatly vary from that,
which I had already obtained. I confess,
that where-ever a clerical person would
have appeared in rather an odious light,
whether it was a Monk or a Nun, a Bishop
or an Abbess, the good lady never failed
to soften matters and wrap the transgressors
up carefully in the veil of mystery;
but those examples of misfortune and heroic
self-command, which appeared so peculiarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>applicable to myself, she confirmed
most fully, and exactly as I had read
them: nor can I decide, whether they
made most impression on me while reading
them alone and for the first time by
the glimmerings of a midnight lamp, or
when they were pronounced by the lips of
this holy woman, this earthly saint, whose
head within a few short years (too soon
alas! for those who like me know her
worth) will be crowned with wreaths of
celestial glory.</p>

<p class='c018'>Though scarcely in the autumn of her
life, the excellent Abbess already stands
upon the brink of her grave. A slow consumption
insensibly destroys her noble
powers, and the repetition of these adventures
was a real sacrifice which she
made to friendship.  Her present state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>adds weight to her testimony. Think
you, Oswald, that so near the transit
from time to eternity, she would waste
away her hours in relating tales, which
she knew to be mere fabrications?—Impossible!</p>

<p class='c018'>No! oh, no! What I have read, is
true! The venerable Urania, on whose
image my eye rests with such soft melancholy,
and thou too, poor Adelaide, whose
bitter fate beguiled me so often of my
tears! you both once lived and suffered,
you both once thought and acted, exactly
as I have read and believed; and these examples
of heroic patience, under afflictions
far heavier than mine, shall serve <i>me</i> as
guides in the conduct, which it now becomes
me to pursue.</p>

<p class='c018'>But for thee, generous Helen! for thee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>whose fortune so thoroughly resembles
my own, from this moment thou shalt be
the model, after which I will form my
whole heart and character; and when my
resolution staggers under the weight of
human weakness, to thy portrait will I
turn my eyes for comfort and support.</p>

<p class='c018'>My brother, I am convinced beyond the
power of doubting, that Helen herself,
and no other, was the authoress of the concluding
manuscript. Every page of it betrays
marks of an interest, which none but
an actor in the tale could be capable of
feeling; and oh! how much has this
persuasion increased in my eyes the value
of the writing!</p>

<p class='c018'>At my request the Abbess pointed out
to me Helen’s picture; and such was my
enthusiastic partiality, that I was weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>enough to fancy a striking likeness between
her features, and those which my
mirror shows me. I made the observation
to my venerable friend; she assented to
it with a smile, and added, “that it was
not in person alone, that I resembled Helen
of Homburg.”—I started, and requested
an explanation as to the parts of Helen’s
history, which were so like my own.
Again the idea of an imposition flitted
across my mind; I believed, what had
passed between myself and Ida to be a total
secret in the Convent; and if the Abbess
was acquainted with my story, it was
still possible, that all which I had heard
from her had been dictated by Abbot Conrad.
Her answer, however, soon removed
this suspicion.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Helen,” said she, “was not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>fair, illustrious, benevolent, and pious,
like Elizabeth, but she was also learned
like Her. I understand, that the exercise
of your pen is your favourite amusement;
and there still exist writings of Helen,
which are well-deserving your attention,
and which I would willingly communicate
to you, my dear Lady, had I not been positively
enjoined to the contrary by superior
orders.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>The recollection of my treachery forced
the colour into my cheeks. To prevent my
confusion being remarked, I hastened to
enquire—“why I was prohibited this pleasure,
and who was my secret enemy?”—The
Abbess shook her head, and confest,
that the writings of ecclesiastical persons
frequently contained circumstances improper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to be made known to the laity, for
fear of giving a shock to their orthodox
opinions.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“But only resolve,” she added smiling,
“to become one of our Sisterhood,
and when I die, I will bequeath you my
station, and full permission to peruse all
the manuscripts deposited in the spacious
archives of this Convent.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ah! my dear brother, were Montfort
a Torrenburg and Ida an Amalberga, how
easy would it be for me to take such a
step! But the ill opinion which I entertain
both of Henry and his mistress, and
my still lively sense of the perfidy and injustice
with which they repaid my affection,
will perhaps make me yet longer hesitate
to act, as would best become me, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>follow the glorious example of self-denial,
set forth in Helen’s conduct.—Farewell,
dear Oswald; my heart is sad, but loves
you tenderly.</p>

  <h3 class='c021'><i>Elizabeth of Torrenburg to Count Oswald.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I have confided my secret history to the
Abbess. In whom can I more properly
confide, than in her who will soon stand
before the Almighty’s throne, and before
whose eyes all concealed things will soon
be made manifest? To whom can I better
apply for advice, than to a soul so near
the boundaries of earthly being, that a ray
of celestial light already illumines it, and
enables her mental vision to see the things
of this world in their proper likeness?</p>

<p class='c018'>She is now informed of every thing;
and I must acknowledge, I was frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>embarrassed by some questions, with
which she every now and then interrupted
my narrative.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Then you are certain, <i>quite</i> certain
of having been the first object of Montfort’s
affection?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I am to understand then, that the
attachment between you was equally
strong, and that his whole soul was as
much devoted to you, as yours was to
him?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>“What? and could he really be so base
as to desert you at the very foot of the
altar, merely because at that moment he
happened to be struck by the charms of
one of your bridemaids? This seems to
me very strange, my daughter; and me-thinks,
it does not well harmonize with
the acknowledged probity of Montfort’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>former conduct.—If he had not loved you,
to be sure he would not have persuaded
you to fly with him from your brother’s
Castle—and yet, if I recollect right, you
mentioned, that his carrying you off
prevented your being compelled to espouse
the aged Count of Torrenburg,
who was then as much the object of your
aversion, as (when his virtues became,
known to you) he was afterwards the object
of your esteem?—You were young,
amiable, in distress, partial to Montfort ...
it is very possible, that love induced him
to advise your flight; but then again it
is also possible, that mere sympathy and
compassion <i>might</i> have led him to give the
very same counsel, and to take the very
same step.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Such was the vexatious mode of arguing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and of seeing things adopted by the
Abbess. I recapitulated the strong reasons
which I had to believe, that in offering
me his hand Montfort was prompted by
affection.——The Abbess acknowledged
their force; but she added—“that it was
very easy for that, which was at <i>first</i> nothing
more than compassionate interest
for the beautiful Elizabeth, to be in time
<i>converted</i> into love.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>This compliment so ill-timed put me
more out of patience, than her humiliating
questions and remarks. It was with
difficulty, that I concealed my ill-humour,
and hastily endeavoured to change the
subject of our discourse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Alas! my dear brother, everyone seems
to be in Montfort’s interests, and averse
to mine. The decision of my venerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>counsellor Albert Reding has just been
communicated to me, and I find.... But
I will not repeat to you, what he says:
what do wealth and power, what do vassals
and domains concern me now?—My
peace is fled, my heart is broken!—</p>

<p class='c018'>The Abbess was not easily persuaded to
quit the subject: and at length she put
some enquiries, which cut me to the very
heart.—They regarded the friend and companion
of my earliest youth, the worthy
Richard of Ulmenhorst, whose love I had
rejected, solely influenced by my partiality
for Montfort. I was thrown into
such confusion by this unexpected home-attack,
that ... I set all politeness fairly
at defiance, and without replying, abruptly
spoke upon another subject.</p>

<p class='c018'>We were sitting in the Abbess’s private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>closet; and I now compelled those portraits,
which had at first excited my curiosity
respecting the secrets of this Convent,
to furnish me with an excuse (good or
bad) for eluding questions, which I felt
but little inclination to answer.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Holy Mother,” said I, “among
all the histories respecting the Ladies of
Sargans which you have related, there is
one still unknown to me. You have always
past over the picture, which represents
two female pilgrims, bewildered
among the barren wilds of a snow-covered
mountain; a picture, which when I first
entered this room, drew more of my attention,
than any of its companions. I at
first believed them to represent the unfortunate
sisters, Emmeline and Amalberga;
but I do not recollect to have heard (I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>had nearly said “to have <i>read</i>”) any circumstances
in their history according with
the scene before me. How anxiously they
seem to be looking for the right path!—Good
Mother, inform me, whether they
found it, and what untoward accident
brought them into their present distress?
You really must make me better acquainted
with their adventures, for my whole
heart already speaks in their favour.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Does it in truth?” said the Abbess,
smiling at my eagerness. “Oh! that
good heart!—But look at the picture
nearer; see whether you can find in the
countenances nothing to justify your partiality,
except the expression of distress?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I drew near, and examined the picture
carefully; but I soon turned away again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and felt, that my cheeks were burning; in
truth something till then unobserved
struck me in the features, but the effect
produced was by no means pleasing.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Well!” enquired the Abbess; “have
you discovered any thing?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“That general family-likeness,” I replied
carelessly, “which is peculiar to the
House of Sargans. But I entreat you,
Mother, inform me, who do those figures
represent?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Two innocent and unfortunate
sisters,” was the Abbess’s answer, “driven
from their proper station, and compelled
even to conceal their very names by a succession
of untoward circumstances, not by
any fault of their own committing. I could
tell you much respecting them, that perhaps
would not appear to you uninteresting;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>but I am too weak to undertake the
task at present. However, not to leave
your curiosity quite unsatisfied, such an
account of them as exists in our archives
shall be looked out, and delivered to
you in the course of this evening. Probably,
you will find this narrative more instructive,
and in every respect better worth
your inspection, than those which I am
compelled to withhold from you, since the
latter were written by Females but little
skilled in literature; while the history, of
which I speak, was transmitted to posterity
by the learned pen of an Abbot of
Cloister-Curwald.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Of Curwald?” I repeated, with a
smile of contempt and incredulity.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Nay, nay, good Countess,” said the
Abbess with some warmth; “no prejudices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>I implore you! The author of
that manuscript, a copy of which I propose
entrusting to you, was no Guiderius,
no Luprian, believe me! No, daughter,
he was one of the wisest and holiest men
of the age, in which he lived; a man in
short, whose virtues conferred honour on
the rank of a prelate, and who was in fact,
as well as in name, a true dignitary of the
church.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I am now waiting in momentary expectation
of receiving the promised manuscript.
The situation, in which I exist
at present, is such, as makes it necessary
for me to seize every means of diverting
the natural current of my thoughts into a
different channel: it is to this necessity,
that a great portion must be ascribed of
the impatience, with which I look forward
to the arrival of this narrative.</p>

    <div>THE SISTERS WITHOUT A NAME.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c021'><i>Written by the Abbot of Cloister-Curwald.</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Above a century has passed away, since
the last heroines of that family, to whose
annals I am preparing to add, quitted the
scene of human action. I say, the <i>last</i>, because
no accounts exist of their successors;
but during that long and vacant period,
who knows, but that many excellent persons
may have acted in a manner which did
credit to their ancestors, though no written
or traditional memorial remains to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>communicate to posterity their virtues
and their woes, their trials and their victories?
My heart delights in the tale,
which records examples of heroic excellence;
and I have frequently censured the
indolence of cotemporary writers, for suffering
this period to remain a blank. Lest
I should deserve that censure myself,
which I have not scrupled to inflict upon
others, I now take up my pen, and proceed
to execute a task, which (should I
live to finish it) will, I trust, rescue from
oblivion some circumstances well-deserving
to be remembered. What I shall set
down will be truth, pure unadorned truth.
A just cause demands not the aid of ornament;
and should these leaves ever meet
the eye of persons, who may think
themselves more nearly interested in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>contents than others, let them not for an
instant suspect, that one syllable is either
inserted or retrenched upon <i>their</i> account,
or with a view to produce any other sentiment
in their bosoms, than a conviction
of the truth. It is not before <i>their</i> tribunal,
that I plead the cause of two unfortunates,
but before that of the whole world:
I write not for them, whose prejudices may
perhaps make them refuse to peruse more
than a few pages of this narrative, and
who may close their eyes obstinately
against the light, which shews them that,
which they are unwilling to see. No; I
write for impartial judges, and will state
my case with as pure and rigid fidelity,
as were I stating it to the ear of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the tranquil vales, which border the
lakes of Thun and of the Four Cantons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>those lakes where Helvetian Liberty first
threw her fetters away, still do the families
exist of those best friends of their native
country, the Melthals, the Forests,
the Bernsdorfs, and the Tells. Their different
branches have spread themselves on
all sides, and almost form a little nation of
their own; whose sons and daughters,
even in a land where honour, bravery,
and truth are so universal, still distinguish
themselves from their compatriots
by the superiority of their virtues. It were
an easy task for me to point out many
Williams, Walters, and Henrics, many
Gertrudes and Amabels in this amiable
community, so perfectly have the good
qualities of their fore-fathers been inherited
by their children: but at present I
shall only mention the inhabitants of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>particular house, which sheltered the infancy
of the heroines of my tale.</p>

<p class='c018'>’Twas the peaceful cottage of a younger
William and a younger Amabel, the descendants
of that Tell, who offered up the
tyrant Gessler as a sacrifice to the insulted
liberties of Helvetia: here among a crowd
of blooming sons and daughters two lovely
girls were remarked, whose appearance
made it evident, that their origin was not
the same with that of their play-mates. It
is true, that they called themselves their
sisters, and were persuaded, that in fact
they were so; but yet the truth was quite
otherwise. The real children of the family
were healthy and strong like the generality
of their kindred; but these two
girls were fair and delicate, and rather resembled
beautiful exotic plants surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>by meadow flowers, to which they condescended
to allow the honour of a common
origin: and however they might themselves
esteem the merits of these simple
children of nature, to all other eyes it was
plain, that their own perfections were far
superior.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have entitled this narrative “the
Sisters without a Name,” for it was long
before they knew the family, from which
they sprung; and when it was at length
revealed to them, they found, that their
rights were in the possession of strangers.
Nay, at the moment that I am writing,
they are still denied the privilege of calling
themselves by the name of an illustrious
House, whose dignity would be disgraced
by the inferior station, in which they are
at present compelled to exist.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>In the early and happiest period of their
lives, the Sisters were totally unconscious
of the magnitude of their claims, and
their minds encouraged no wish to be
greater than they were. Happy in the
humble sphere for which they believed
themselves ordained, happy in the shades
of their mountains, in the tranquillity of
their flowery vallies and glassy lakes, they
considered the scenes which surrounded
them, and which appeared to them so enchanting,
as a beautiful specimen of the
whole world; nor did they ever trouble
their heads with a thought, whether beyond
those mountains, and on the outside
of those vallies, there existed objects which
were deserving of a wish to be acquainted
with. This fortunate unconsciousness
was assiduously preserved in their minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>by those, to whose care they were confided;
and on winter-evenings, when William
Tell had collected all his children
around him (among whom the Sisters
were still reckoned) the stories, with which
he entertained them, always respected some
hero or heroine of ancient Helvetia; so
that nothing was made known to them
except the country which gave them birth,
and they were led to consider nothing as
of importance but what related to that
country, because of that country alone had
they ever been told any thing important.
In the same manner were they instructed
respecting the concerns of human life:
every illustration was selected from the
lower or middling classes of society  and
the manners and customs of the great
would have been totally unknown to them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>had it not been for an old man, over
whose head near a century had past, and
who was a member of the happy family,
in which the Sisters resided. This good
father would often take the two girls
apart from their playmates, and recount
to them particulars of the ancient Houses
of Carlsheim, Torrenburg, and Homburg.
Mary and Rosanna (so were the Sisters
called, while under Tell’s roof) listened
to him with the greatest interest, and
each selected a heroine from among the
Helens, Emmelines, and Uranias, as the
object of her peculiar admiration.</p>

<p class='c018'>But such ladies of those illustrious families,
as had finished their lives in a cloister,
were sure of obtaining the favour of the
gentle serious Mary. She was not fourteen,
when she made a pilgrimage to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Convent of Engelberg for the purpose of
kissing the stone, on which Amalberga was
kneeling, when surprised by Landenberg’s
emissaries; and she frequently expressed
a wish, that she might one day be permitted
to take the veil in that Convent, which
had so long given shelter to the heiress of
Sargans.</p>

<p class='c018'>The laughing Rosanna often added to
this wish an assertion, that her sister
hoped like Amalberga to exchange in due
time the cloister for a bridal garland; but
Mary’s conduct sufficiently proved, that
her religious vocation was at that time no
affectation. She was just sixteen, when
William Tell was obliged to comply with
her entreaties, and suffer her to reside at
Engelberg. He seemed to consent to this
step unwillingly: but he comforted himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>with the reflection, that the rules of
this House permitted no one to pronounce
the irrevocable vow, who had not completed
her twenty-fifth year; a period, before
whose arrival a thousand accidents
must necessarily have taken place, capable
of shaking the most determined resolutions
and the most ardent zeal.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanna accompanied her sister to the
Convent, and for a few days forced herself
to be pleased and satisfied with the religious
tranquillity of her new abode. But
at length she could no longer conceal from
herself, that nothing save Mary’s society
could have made the manners of a convent
endurable; and that in fact she was
much better calculated for singing and
dancing with her young companions on
the village green, than for attending the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Abbess and her Nuns to the midnight
mass. She therefore endeavoured to give
her occupations some variety by taking an
active part in the internal arrangements of
the Convent.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanna was beautiful, but as yet no
one had told her so. None of the neighbouring
youths pleased her enough to
make any impression upon <i>her</i>, and the
consequence was, that her charms made
but little impression upon <i>them</i>. With
all her vivacity, there was a certain something
in Rosanna’s manner, which kept
the multitude in awe. Every one admired
her, wished her well, was pleased to see
her join in their amusements, but she produced
no warmer sentiment. A kind of
dignity, of which she was herself unconscious,
prevented the young men from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>being as much at their ease with her, as
with her companions, and kept even the
least abashed of them at a distance: at
length the society was increased by the arrival
of a person, who only required to be
seen, in order to inspire her with a wish to
obtain from him something more than indifference,
or mere dispassionate approbation.</p>

<p class='c018'>The ancient friendship established between
the families of William Tell and
Henric Melthal was kept up by their descendants
in all its original vigour. A son
of that Alwyn Melthal, who played the
chief part at the capture of Rassburg, was
still alive, and nearly of the same age with
that old relation of William Tell, whom I
formerly mentioned. Both these venerable
men were still fresh and hearty in spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>of their advanced time of life; such is indeed
the natural effect of breathing the
pure mountain air, and living far from
the vices and excesses of cities. The two
families often met together, and their days
of festivity were always observed in
common.</p>

<p class='c018'>Old Melthal had several children; but
now it was rumoured, that one of them
called Erwin (whom no one recollected to
have ever heard of before) was just returned
from foreign parts, and that a
great feast was shortly to be given in honour
of his safe arrival. Accordingly, the
venerable chief of the Melthals made a
tour through the neighbouring districts,
for the purpose of inviting his relations
and intimates to assemble on the
green lawn before his house on an appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>day; thence to accompany his
newly-arrived son to the old church on
the banks of the Lake, and return thanks
to Heaven for his prosperous return; and
finally, to pass the remainder of the day
and a good portion of the following night
at his expence in various festivities and
amusements.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell’s family was one of the first invited:
the expectation of the approaching
entertainment gave a look of joy to every
countenance. In the great world, no one
looks forward to a day marked out for
some amusement with half this enthusiasm:
the hurry of tiresome and expensive
preparations; recollections, how often
on similar occasions we have expected
more amusement, than we received; the
frequent recurrence of such pleasures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>which robs them of the charm of novelty;
the suggestions of mortified vanity or dissatisfied
pride; all these combine to embitter
the festivals of the great. But here in
the land of innocence and gaiety, here
where no one looks for any pleasure, but
that which he is sure of finding; where
pride and vanity have nothing to do;
where every recollection is delightful, and
the whole expence and preparation consist
in a wreath of fresh-gathered flowers;
here it is, that an invitation to a party of
pleasure is really welcome, and seldom
fails of justifying its name.</p>

<p class='c018'>The sun was not yet risen, and the
youths and damsels of Tell’s family were
already on their road to Melthal’s cottage.
Lots were cast among the girls to decide,
who should have the honour to conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the procession; the chance fell upon Rosanna.
In consequence, she added to that
which confined her locks, a second wreath
of flowers which she hung round her arm,
ready (as was the custom on such occasions)
to crown the hero of the entertainment.
It was a special privilege enjoyed
by that company of young people, which
arrived first at the place of rendezvous,
that a similar garland to that, with which
themselves were adorned, should ornament
the head of the principal personage,
whereas the garlands of the others could
only be worn by relations of that particular
family; and this privilege was one,
which they valued highly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell’s children, therefore, entreated their
sister Rosanna to hasten forwards, in order
that no one might arrive before them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>and obliging as she ever was, she quickened
her steps, though solely from the desire to
comply with their wishes: for she little guessed
the sort of youth, for whom her garland
had been woven. She expected to see a person,
who would be as indifferent to her as
all those were, whom she had already seen;
and it was a matter of little concern to
her, whether she ornamented with her
garland the locks of the young Melthal,
or of one of her own relations.</p>

<p class='c018'>But how were her sentiments changed,
when at the head of her company she arrived
on the brow of a little hill, and
looked down upon Melthal’s cottage!
There sat the old man on a stone bench
before the door; and near him stood a
youth, whose countenance was illumined
by the rosy light of the rising sun, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>whose figure excelled in manly beauty
every thing that she had ever seen, nay
that she had ever thought or dreamt of.—She
started back.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What!” said she to herself; “can
this be a son of the old Henric Melthal?
No, no! ’tis certainly some angel, or some
saint or martyr at the least. In truth, I
never saw one of the beings, to whom
those names are applied; but I have been
told much respecting such supernatural
Existences, and surely if they ever deign
to visit the earth in human form, they
must needs resemble yonder youth.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Erwin Melthal appeared to be in earnest
conversation with his father: but no
sooner was he aware of the approaching
guests, than he hastened towards them,
and delivered a welcome with such unaffected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>grace and easy dignity, that Rosanna’s
delight and astonishment were raised
to the very highest pitch.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell’s family was in fact the first arrived,
and Rosanna’s garland was without a competitor
for the honour of adorning Erwin’s
head; an honour, which she now
no longer looked upon as a matter of indifference,
and which she could not have
consented to make over to one of her companions
without some little movements of
jealousy and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c018'>She approached the stranger, while her
cheeks were suffused with blushes, and
her hand trembled, as she drew the garland
from her arm. He stood before her
like some well grown cedar, and bowed
down his head a little to be crowned by
the lovely stranger. She hesitated, retired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>a few steps, and looked anxiously round
to her female companions, as if she would
willingly have given up her office to one
of them: while Erwin, either out of respect
and admiration at the heavenly vision
which now stood manifest before him,
or from the more earthly consideration of
the difference between her stature and his
own, sank upon one knee before her, and
in this attitude was crowned by her trembling
hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was an established custom, that the
conductress of the first company that arrived,
on these occasions should be the
partner of the king of the festival during
the whole of the day. Rosanna, who
loved to enjoy the earliest breath of morning
and the glories of the rising sun, had
already frequently obtained this privilege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>without its causing her much emotion;
but now when she reflected, that for a
whole day she should be by the side of
Erwin Melthal; that she should kneel on
the same step with him at church; should
join at the same time and almost in the
same breath with him in the most solemn
offices of devotion; should blend her voice
with his in prayers and anthems; and
that at table, in the dance, at every kind
of festivity, she should still have no associate
but Erwin, all this was too much for
her to conceive at once, and her feelings
scarcely permitted her to breathe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still she only dared to express those
feelings by looks and blushes: but Erwin,
who felt the same, was not confined like
her by the restraints of decorum. He
made use of the privilege of his sex, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>not only spoke, but spoke so plainly, that
little as Rosanna was skilled in the language
of love, which she then first heard
from his lips, she still understood his
meaning; and little as she ventured to answer,
still before the entertainment concluded,
she had left no doubt upon his
mind, that their affection was mutual. The
embarrassment, which took place at their
first meeting; the gift of her garland; the
religious ceremonies in which they had been
engaged together, and in which each had
stolen a little from that which was destined
for Heaven, for the purpose of bestowing
it on the other; all these circumstances
and a thousand other trifles, which occurred
in the course of the entertainment, assured
them, that an exchange of hearts
had taken place, that their sentiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>were sanctioned by the approbation of
Heaven, and that every thing would turn
out as they wished and expected.</p>

<p class='c018'>From this day forwards Erwin’s leisure
was totally engrossed by Rosanna. The
habitations of Tell and Melthal were not
so very distant, but that by setting out at
the same time the lovers were certain to
meet halfway, time enough to pass some
hours together undisturbed: besides the
intimate connection, which subsisted between
the two families, furnished too many
opportunities of intercourse, to admit of
their often complaining of long absence
from each other. The passion, which
grew stronger in their bosoms with every
hour, was carefully concealed from every
one; not that they had any reason to apprehend
censure from their superiors; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>because secrecy seemed to give an additional
charm to the correspondence of their
hearts, and because the goal of their desires
seemed to be still at a considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c018'>The venerable Melthal, the youth’s
great-grandfather, had caused him to be
educated in a foreign country, and intended
him for the profession of arms.
Erwin had been long suffered to remain
ignorant, both to what family he belonged,
and to what country he owed his origin:
but the good antient (whom the number
of his years rather than any sensible infirmity
made conscious, that the close of his
existence could not be far removed) now
thought proper to summon his grandson
to a private conference, in which he disclosed
to him many particulars of great
importance.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>—“One more campaign,” said Erwin
to his mistress, the first time that he saw
her after holding this conversation with
old Melthal, “one more campaign under
the Emperor’s banners, in whose service
I am at present engaged; and then will I
hasten back to lay my laurels at the feet of
my Rosanna, confess my love for her, and
fix my habitation with her in that quarter
of the globe, which her fancy shall prefer.
If she thinks proper still to reside in the
shades of her native vallies, there too will
I take up my abode: if she rather desires
to see the world (which in truth has its
charms and can show some scenes, with
which even these enchanting solitudes
must not come in competition) perhaps
her happy Erwin may succeed in procuring
for her there a situation better suited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>her merits, than that which she must fill
in the obscurity of these retired mountains.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Dear Erwin,” interrupted Rosanna,
“speak no more of this; speak not
of my merits, or of removing me to the
great world! Ah! why must you needs
yourself go thither? Is it not enough to
make me hate that world, that it soon must
rob me of your society? and alas! who
knows, whether you will return from that
wild tumult, which I only know by description,
with sentiments as kind and as
honest and true an heart, as you will bear
away with you!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Rosanna was bathed in tears,
while she made these representations. She
had had dreams, and omens, and forebodings,
which promised nothing good,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>and which her lover soon banished by
means, which every lover (the false as
well as the true) equally practises on similar
occasions. But Erwin was true as the
truest; and his oaths were heard and registered
in the Book of Eternity by the
Angel, who suffers no perjury to escape
unpunished.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was one person in the world,
with whom Rosanna had been too long
accustomed to share all her joys and all her
sorrows, all her hopes and all her fears,
not to make her feel uneasy under the profound
secrecy, which she had hitherto imposed
on herself respecting her attachment:
that person was Mary. In fact,
she had already suffered some distant hints
to escape her, that she had a secret to communicate;
and at length she summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>up all her resolution, and (with Erwin’s
approbation) set forward one morning for
the Convent of Engelberg, determined to
lay her whole heart open to her sister’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c018'>Though Mary found her own felicity
within the bounds of cloistered retirement,
her notions were too liberal to make her
consider it as improper, that Rosanna
should seek for happiness in the arms of an
affectionate husband. With folded hands
and a countenance bright with tranquil
joy, she piously invoked a blessing on her
sister’s union with the honest-hearted Erwin;
though she could not help lamenting
with a sigh, that he should have adopted
the profession of Blood! Before they separated,
it was settled between the Sisters,
that on an appointed day Rosanna should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>conduct her lover to the Convent, in order
that Mary might become personally
acquainted with her future brother.</p>

<p class='c018'>This interview was not difficult to be
procured; Mary had not yet pronounced
her vows, and was left at perfect liberty
to employ her time, as she thought proper.
Yet partly from a wish to make the business
no more public than could be avoided,
and partly from a movement of religious
enthusiasm which forcibly operated upon
her imagination, Mary desired, that the
meeting should not take place, till the
evening was on the point of closing.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was in autumn, and the weather
proved gloomy. Mary had provided herself
with a key of the Chapel, and it was
in this awful place, that she received the
lovers. A small porch, faintly lighted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>the glimmerings of a distant lamp, witnessed
their first meeting. Mary (who
in spite of her extreme youth had already
adopted the dignity and grave character
appropriate to her destined station) spoke
long and seriously to the warrior, respecting
the sincerity of his attachment and the sacred
nature of his engagement to Rosanna.
His answers were such as she most
desired to hear; and she now conducted
them into the Chapel, where she had already
placed two burning tapers before an
altar consecrated to Saint Engeltruda.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Kneel,” said she, “kneel upon
the stone, on which Amalberga was
kneeling when seized by the sacrilegious
Landenberg; kneel, and swear in
the presence of God and of this chapel’s
Patron-Saint, never even in thought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>swerve from the strictest rules of eternal
truth and unsullied virtue: so shall this
place be cleansed from the pollution, which
it contracted from the impure steps of the
virgin’s ravisher!—May Landenberg’s fate
be thine, Erwin, shouldst thou ever for
one instant prove faithless to Rosanna!—Never
may’st thou, Rosanna, find in the
time of need such a preserver as Amalberga
found in Eginhart, shouldst thou ever
forget the man, to whom I now solemnly
betroth thee in the face of listening
Heaven.—Let nothing part you, but the
grave!—And should hereafter either of
you from inconstancy or caprice rend
asunder the sacred bonds, with which I
now unite your fates for ever, that instant
shall my form (be I living, or be I
dead) stand before you threatening and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>awful, and warn you to return to the
paths of propriety and duty!—But peace,
everlasting peace be with the bosoms of
faith, and may the wings of angels overspread
them and preserve them!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Erwin and Rosanna, as they gazed on
the lovely form, which stood before them
illuminated by the pale light of the consecrated
tapers, fancied themselves in the
presence of some celestial being. They
thought, that in her words they heard the
voice of her Patron-Saint; they swore
fidelity while life should last, and Mary
kissed and blessed them.</p>

<p class='c018'>She then accompanied them to the
Chapel-porch; and the betrothed or rather
the espoused lovers (for as such they now
considered themselves) bent their course
homewards beneath a sky heavy with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>the dews of an autumnal evening. Not
one syllable did they exchange, as they
past along; a gentle pressure of the hand
occasionally was the only manner, in which
they gave token of their feelings. Yet
was their joy not quite unclouded; a secret
heaviness weighed down their hearts:
melancholy forebodings forbade their
abandoning themselves entirely to the delightful
thought—“We are united for
ever!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>The three actors in this solemn and singular
scene had not enveloped their secret
in so impenetrable a veil, as they imagined;
and this transaction was the means of their
meeting with many severe reproofs from
those, to whom they were in subjection.
The youthful devotee had been watched
by an inquisitive Nun; and the respectable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>office, which she had thought proper
to perform on this occasion, was made
known to the Abbess the next morning.
Severe were the censures past by that
good lady on Mary’s boldness, in assuming
a character so ill adapted to her time
of life. On the other hand, each of the
lovers was closeted by the chief of their
respective families; and many representations
were laid before them in these private
conferences, which seemed to make great
impression on the minds of both, though
they had not the smallest effect in diminishing
their mutual attachment. At
their next meeting Erwin revealed not to
Rosanna one word of the conversation,
which he had held with his grandfather
Melthal; neither on <i>her</i> side was Rosanna
more communicative of the information,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>which she had gained from the old William
Tell. They only confest to each
other, that the main-topic of both these
secret conferences had been reasons for
their renouncing their so lately contracted
union; and the question was exchanged—“Whether
what each had heard, but
which neither revealed, was of such force,
as to authorize their breaking vows, which
had been pronounced with such solemnity”—“No!”—uttered
in a tone so positive,
as to convey in it a renewal of all
their former oaths, was the reply on both
sides: yet they agreed to commit their
cause to Heaven and Time, and to suffer,
to hope, and to believe, what (in secret
each was compelled to own) appeared then
to be impossible.</p>

<p class='c018'>That Erwin and Rosanna were mutually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>attached to each other, had been long suspected;
but the fact was now made
known throughout the Province, and the
prejudice ran universally in favour of the
lovers. The youths and damsels exclaimed
loudly against the severity of the two
fathers; and even the old people shook
their heads, and let a few words escape
them now and then about inexplicable obstinacy.
They declared, that Melthal’s
son and Tell’s daughter seemed to be formed
for one another, that they ought to be
united, and that united they would be
some day or other, happen what might.
Whenever they encountered the dejected
lovers, they never failed to whisper some
kind exhortations to be faithful, and to
hope for better times; while on the other
hand their young companions were anxious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to furnish them with opportunities
of meeting, and frequently in their village
festivals the lovers suddenly found themselves
encircled by the same chain of
flowers, and heard every voice unite in
singing the praise of their tender attachment
and their wishes for its happy issue.
A thousand ballads were made upon them,
some plaintive, some gay, and they circulated
from mouth to mouth with rapidity;
for the love of Erwin and Rosanna
was an affair, in which the whole
Province felt itself interested.</p>

<p class='c018'>This universal good-will, however, advanced
their cause but little. When they
were alone, each spoke of eternal fidelity
and insurmountable difficulties; each
made it evident, that a secret sorrow
weighed heavy upon the heart; each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>found fault with the father of the other,
and declared him to be extremely in the
wrong; while the father of the speaker
was asserted to be perfectly in the right,
at the same time that to obey him was acknowledged
to be impossible. As to the two
old men, they took no steps towards an
explanation. It was rather observed, that
from this time forward they shunned each
other’s society, and seemed by the mutual
distance thus suddenly created between
them, to give their children a hint of the
conduct, which they expected them also
to adopt.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sooner than they were aware, chance
relieved them from the troublesome employment
of watching over the lovers.
Erwin was unexpectedly summoned to
join the Emperor’s army, and the orders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>were so pressing, as not even to permit
his taking leave of his mistress. Yet as
he past by it on his road, he said a short
but fervent prayer in the Chapel of Engelberg;
he commended himself and his fortunes
to the protection of that Saint, who
had heard his vows pronounced; and
Mary being fortunately among the Nuns,
and within reach of his eye, he implored
her by signs to bear his melancholy greeting
to her sister. Mary perfectly understood
the meaning of those signs; though
it was long, before an opportunity presented
itself for complying with his wish.
Ever since her culpable interference in unhallowed
love-affairs, the virtuous Lady
Abbess had caused a strict watch to be
kept over Mary; and though Rosanna’s
heart was full and greatly needed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>consolations of a sister’s tenderness, she
still hesitated to visit Engelberg. The secret,
which the old Tell had revealed to her,
was a dead weight upon her heart; she
knew well, that it was her duty to make
it immediately known to Mary, who was
no less interested in it than herself; and
she trembled to hear the decision, which
(she doubted not) would be pronounced
even by her truest friend and the partial favourer
of her love, as soon as she should be
made acquainted with the real nature of
the case.</p>

<p class='c018'>The useful art of penmanship, which a
century before had been familiar in these
parts, and practised by persons totally unconnected
with learned pursuits, even by
women, (as the annals of the Ladies of
Sargans testify,) at the present period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>was fallen into neglect. With the exception
of some few characters of distinguished
merit, it was confined to the
clergy, and alas! in this respect Erwin
and Rosanna were completely laical: neither
was it safe or prudent to confide
their tender secrets to the discretion of
chance messengers; and it necessarily followed,
that the lovers were but seldom
informed of the proceedings of each
other. Common fame however occasionally
brought the maid tidings of her warrior
not less strange than satisfactory;
and the girls of the Valley frequently were
able to comfort their sorrowing companion
with reports, which asserted Erwin’s
heroism to be only equalled by his good
fortune. Rosanna’s heart readily gave
credit to assertions so flattering; and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>was too well disposed to believe them, to
require much proof of their veracity;
nay, she sometimes was so completely fascinated
by the illusions of Fancy, that she
could not refrain from communicating her
hopes to the venerable Tell.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Surely, my good father,” would
she say to him, “should Erwin return to
me crowned with honour and renown;
should he be really what Fame asserts, the
favourite of his Emperor, what is more
probable, than that the lowness of his origin
should be sunk in the splendour of
some new-acquired title, and his merits be
rewarded by his elevation to some station
of importance? and in that case, where
would be the impropriety of my giving
him my hand? and what obstacle would
my mother’s injunctions oppose any longer
to our union?”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>The old man on hearing such observations
never failed to exclaim against the
credulity of young minds, and to warn
the exulting girl against the painful effect,
which evil tidings would produce upon
her mind with as much facility and with
still greater violence. They say, that Age
often possesses the gift of second-sight; it
is at least certain, that what Tell foreboded,
happened but too soon. On a
sudden, Rosanna’s Companions greeted her
arrival no more with chearful songs of encouragement
and hope; the name of the
heroic Erwin now was never suffered to
pass their lips; when she enquired, whether
no tidings of him had reached the
Valley, her question was evaded. At
length the deep mourning, in which the
Melthal family appeared, made public the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>dreadful intelligence, which her friends
had so long concealed from her, and the
relation of which struck her senseless to
the earth, as if it had been a flash of lightning.
Erwin had accompanied his sovereign
to relieve the Fortress of Bender,
which was besieged by Sultan Amurath,
and in an unsuccessful attack upon the
enemy’s camp had fallen as became a warrior.
The whole Valley was afflicted at his
loss; the old Melthal was inconsolable.
Shortly afterwards he left his home to
visit the Castle of a nobleman, who had
been long his patron and his friend, and
he returned no more. Death surprised
him on his journey; and his children
brought nothing back but his bones, which
they buried in his native land, that land
which through life he had ever loved so
dearly!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>It seemed, as if at this period every kind
of misfortune had conspired to ruin this
once so happy Province. It was visited
by continual storms, such as had never before
taken place within the memory of
man: the mountain-torrents deluged the
country with unusual fury; nor was it
possible for the cultivators, industrious as
they were, to bring their ruined fields
into order again, till a considerable time
had elapsed. The crops failed; prices
rose; at length the distress became universal,
and it was soon followed by the
twin-sisters of Death, Famine and Disease.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanna saw so many of the venerable
fathers of the Valley sink into the grave,
and wept over the tombs of so many of her
youthful friends, that she could not but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>expect the lot soon to fall upon herself and
her good old grandfather. The first was
as earnestly desired by Her, who languished
to embrace her Erwin in the land of
shadows, as the latter was looked forward
to with terror. She anxiously wished to
lengthen the days of one, who was now almost
her only friend, and she implored
him to retire for a while from a spot become
so dangerous. It was not far from
Tell’s habitation to the Convent of Engelberg,
and there the plague had not as yet
commenced its ravages. Mary obtained
permission from the Abbess to take possession
of an uninhabited monastery,
which made part of the domains of Engelberg;
and she now hastened like some
benevolent Angel to guide her sickening
relations to the place of refuge, which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>had found for them, and where she proposed
to be their nurse herself. As many
as were still capable of moving, blest her,
and followed her to the Monastery; Rosanna
and Tell made part of the melancholy
caravan, which Death had taken
care to prevent from being numerous. In
defiance of the extreme danger, Mary resided
with them, and administered to
their necessities with her own hands. Her
exertions were crowned with their deserved
success; she had the happiness of
rescuing all her patients from the grave,
except the grey-headed Tell. Yet even
He did not fall a martyr to the plague;
Mary’s unceasing efforts had relieved him
from that poisonous enemy; but the
weight of near an hundred years prest
him down, and forbade his ever rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>again from that bed, from whose side, during
the time of his most imminent danger,
he had vainly entreated Mary and her
sister to retire and attend to their own
preservation.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“My children,” said he at length,
when no doubt remained that the hour of
his death was at hand, “I feel, that we
must part: and long as my worldly course
has lasted, still at its close does nothing
press heavy on my heart except the reflection,
that I leave your fate and fortunes
undecided. Rosanna, have you communicated
to your sister those circumstances,
which I thought fit to lay before you, in
order that you might be convinced, that
an union with Erwin Melthal would be ill-sorted
and improper in every point of
view?”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Rosanna replied in the negative; she
had of late found but few opportunities,
she said, of seeing her sister; and
even when they were together, the Lady
Abbess (whose notions of decorum had
been greatly shocked at the share, which
Mary had taken in the Chapel-scene) had
watched them with such vigilance, as effectually
prevented any confidential communications.
She concluded her apology
for having so long neglected to obey his
injunctions, by entreating him to suffer
Mary to retain the pleasing illusion that
she had a right to his affection; an illusion,
with which she herself had parted
so unwillingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“It must not be,” answered the expiring
Tell; “it is necessary, that both of
you should be aware, that you are no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>grandchildren of mine. The story of
your birth is long; Rosanna is informed
of all the circumstances, and will relate
them to you, my gentle Mary, at some
hour of leisure: at present learn from me
such points, as are most essential.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You and your sister are the sole remaining
descendants of the younger
branch of the ancient and illustrious families
of Carlsheim and Sargans. That you
have past so large a portion of your lives
in obscurity, and that your great expectations
are still in so questionable a state,
you must accuse the superstitious obstinacy
of the Countess, your deceased mother.
She was a daughter of the Count
of Mayenfield, and her extraordinary
beauty made her the object of universal
admiration.  Among her suitors were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>numbered the heads of the two families of
Torrenburg and Werdenberg, both equally
descended from the united House of
Carlsheim and Sargans. The latter was
accepted; the former was not only rejected,
but even held by your mother in the
most absolute detestation. On the contrary,
the Count of Torrenburg (who is
still alive, and whose excellent heart never
harboured resentment against any human
being,) not only forgave the slight, but
continued on the most friendly terms
with his successful rival. He succeeded in
expelling from his bosom his unfortunate
passion, bestowed his heart on another
lady more capable of estimating its worth,
and his marriage was blest with two sons,
as was that of the Count of Werdenberg
with two daughters. On this fortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>occurrence taking place, the fathers entered
into the most solemn engagements to
unite their children in marriage, and by
this means blend inseparably their mutual
claims upon the inheritance of each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My lovely girls, you were these daughters
thus betrothed while in the cradle: I
cannot express to you the repugnance,
with which your mother entertained the
idea, that she should one day hear you
call the sons of the Count of Torrenburg
by the name of husband. The antipathy,
which she bore that family, was increased
a thousandfold by the death of her husband;
on which event the great domains
of your father (according to the long-established
customs of the Houses, to which
you owe your origin) fell to the only remaining
male heirs of the Counts of Carlsheim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>and Sargans, the Count of Torrenburg
and his sons. The prospect of recovering
the whole of this inheritance by your
union with those sons, and the generous
offers made by their father for her accommodation,
had no effect in softening her
animosity: she felt, that it was less disagreeable
to lose every thing and sacrifice
both herself and you, than to depart in
any degree from her obstinate resolution.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Accordingly she quitted the Castle of
Werdenberg in the greatest privacy, and
concealed herself in my humble habitation.
I had been long known to her, and in general
had been honoured with her confidence;
but she carefully hid from me the
real situation of her affairs and the true
motives of her conduct. She did not
long survive the loss of her husband;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>grief for his death and vexation at the
good fortune of Torrenburg rapidly destroyed
her health. On her death-bed she
demanded from me a solemn oath, that I
would adopt her orphan-daughters for my
own, and would bring them up according
to the instructions, which after her decease
I should find conveyed in writing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That your prudent mother should prefer
your being educated in the lap of rural
innocence and tranquillity, rather than in
the tumult of the great world, did not
surprise me in the least, and I readily
gave the oath demanded. But when after
her death I learned from her papers the
whole extent of my promise, and found
myself enjoined to spread the report of
your death, and never to disclose your
real names, unless circumstances should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>give you a just claim to the inheritance of
your ancestors, my surprise was extreme;
and gladly would I have called back the
oath, which your mother had carried with
her into the grave, and which therefore
was irrevocable.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As the case stood, no choice was left
me, and I was compelled to obey your
mother’s injunctions respecting your education.
It greatly comforted me to find,
that the secret of your real station was
not confined to myself. The deceased
Countess mentioned in her will, that the
Bishop of Coira and the Abbot of Cloister-Curwald
(both of them related to her
though but distantly) were aware of her
design, and had sanctioned it with their
consent; and I concluded, that since her
determination had found favour in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>eyes of such learned and respectable persons,
it must needs have claims to approbation,
which my own understanding was
too short-sighted to discover.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“It is possible,” it was thus that the
Countess exprest herself in her last will;
“it is possible, however trifling the probability
seems at present, that the family
of Torrenburg may become extinct; or
that it may please Heaven to deprive it of
male heirs, as it has been pleased to deprive
the family of Werdenberg. In that
case, let the claims of my daughters be advanced,
and the documents produced,
which are deposited in the hands of the
Bishop of Coira, and in the archives of
Cloister-Curwald: for the rights of these
consolidated families are so ordained, that
the daughters can only lay claim to the inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>of their ancestors, in case no
male heir should exist; a regulation, on
whose justice I am too little learned to
give an opinion, and whose effect I possess
too little power to counteract.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But as it is possible, that my orphan
daughters may one day become the heiresses
of Sargans, care must be taken to
prevent their adopting any measure,
which may make them blush at recollecting
the obscurity, in which they are to
pass their early years. I desire therefore,
that you William Tell (whom I appoint
their guardian) should not only bring
them up innocently and virtuously, but
should make them mistresses of as many
elegant accomplishments, as circumstances
will admit. Above all I command you on
no account to suffer them to contract a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>marriage unsuitable to their illustrious
birth. Unless a mother’s fondness deceives
me, they will be singularly beautiful.
Providence ever watches over the
orphan’s destiny; and perhaps even in
their humble station their charms may attract
the observant glance of some young
nobleman. Should such be the case, William
Tell is at liberty to remove all obstacles
to such an union, by revealing to the
lover the real name of the parents of my
daughters; and I also absolve him from
his oath in so far, as to authorize him to
disclose to themselves the secret of their
illustrious origin, whenever they are sufficiently
arrived at years of discretion, to
make such a disclosure necessary or useful.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Here is this important paper,” resumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Tell after a short pause, for this
long discourse had greatly exhausted him;
“you will read it over together at your
leisure: but one thing more I must observe
to you. The Countess was no less
averse to the seclusion of a convent than
to ill-assorted marriages.—In one place
(which I have pointed out for Mary’s observation
by three crosses) she writes thus—“Be
the veil the last refuge of my children,
and on no account must either of
them be suffered to assume it before her
six-and-twentieth year. Then, if no more
inviting prospect presents itself, their real
rank may be revealed to the Superior, and
the sums (which I leave for that purpose
in the hands of William Tell) appropriated
to the endowment of the Convent, in
which they think proper to pronounce
their vows.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>—“I trust,” continued the old man,
“that I have not abused the confidence with
which your noble mother honoured me.
Anxiety to leave no part of her commands
unexecuted made me lose no time in hastening
to the Bishop of Coira and the Abbot
of Cloister-Curwald, and requesting their
advice respecting your future education.
I found them already fully acquainted with
the intentions of the deceased Countess; I
also gathered from some words which escaped
them, that all the singular injunctions
of that lady’s will related to an old
prophecy, by which the daughters of
Werdenberg were threatened with the
most severe mortifications and persecutions
through the means of the family of
Torrenburg. For my own part, I cannot
say, that I lay any great stress upon these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>old traditions, and even look upon belief
in them as little better than rank superstition:
nay, I am almost persuaded, that the
very means taken to avoid the dangers
with which such prophecies menace us,
frequently produce their accomplishment,
of which (unless I am much deceived)
your own history will furnish an additional
proof. The two reverend gentlemen,
however, were quite of a different opinion
from me on this point; in truth, they received
so ill a hint of this nature which
escaped me, that if I had not held my
tongue in good time, I verily believe, they
would have excommunicated me as an
arch-heretic. Luckily, the business was
not to decide, whether your mother’s opinions
were right, but whether her will
should be obeyed; and on this head all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>three were of the same way of thinking.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Annually I made them a visit to lay
before them my proceedings, and receive
instructions respecting your future conduct.
At length they died, both nearly at
the same time, and were succeeded by
Bishop Sigisbert, and Abbot Conrad the
Fourth, who also succeeded to the knowledge
of your secret. The latter of those
prelates (as you probably remember) once
visited our cottage, as it seemed, by accident.
He saw you, and felt himself greatly
interested in your welfare. I have informed
him of my illness, and also of the
melancholy occurrences which have lately
taken place, and which render these vallies
no longer a safe retreat. In his answer,
the good Abbot promises you his protection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>proposes to remove you to those
scenes where your noble ancestors once
ruled, and engages (when the proper time
shall be arrived) to support your claims to
the utmost of his power.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The sons of the Count of Torrenburg
are dead; the Count himself is a widower,
but is not quite so far advanced in years as
to make his contracting a second marriage
highly improbable. Still you have much
to expect from his known generosity of
mind, and I cannot but flatter myself, that
you may look forwards to more fortunate
times! Oh! with what content could I
lay my head down in my grave, were I
but certain that this hope will soon be realized!
But alas! every thing shows itself
to me, as if still at a fearful distance!
Every thing seems covered with a gloomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>veil of clouds. Many and many a bitter
sigh must you heave, many and many a
painful step must you tread, ere you regain
that station, whence you have been degraded
by maternal obstinacy and superstitious
prejudice.—Yet take courage, my
children; an invisible hand still guides the
steps of the innocent, and you will find a
powerful friend and safe adviser in the
Abbot of Cloister-Curwald.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Here the old man concluded; his adopted
daughters were silent, and wept.—All
that they had heard, all the glorious prospects,
which were just presented before
them, were unable to overpower the melancholy
conviction, that the hour was arrived,
when they must close the eyes of
that venerable man, who had for so many
years cherished them with all the fondness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>of a father. In losing him, they foresaw
too the loss of those simple pleasures,
which had made their childhood glide
away so gaily, and for which they feared
to find the advantages of their new situation
but a sorry and incomplete exchange.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell visibly became weaker, that is, his
body became so; but his mind preserved
its strength unimpaired, and to the last
moment of sensibility possest its gaiety
and freedom. He had indeed got the better
of that illness, which at first confined
him to a sick couch, but he sank under
the burthen of his years. His heart at
length felt the arrow of death; though in
truth that metaphor is here inapplicable,
for he felt no wound, he endured no pain.
His existence ended in a gradual peaceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>slumber; the lamp of his life was extinguished
gently and imperceptibly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Abbot Conrad arrived before the decease
of Tell, for the purpose of removing the
Sisters: but they implored a short respite.
Gladly would they have remained Tell’s
daughters all their lives; it was no light
blow, that could sever the bonds, by which
they were connected with the good old
man; even Death was unable to effect
this completely, and their affection still
followed him even beyond the grave.
Neither was Conrad anxious to remove
them from the dying man: it was a blessed
sight for him to witness the gentle departure
of a just spirit, and for once to behold
the so-dreaded form of Death arrayed
in the peaceful appearance of a beneficent
Angel. Neither was it an uninteresting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>sight, to see two girls in the
bloom of youth and beauty turning away
from the brilliant prospects of the world,
to dwell with their whole souls on one of
the most sorrowful and painful scenes,
which can meet the eye of human nature;
to see two highly-born princesses weep at
resigning for such sounding titles the
dearer-ones of daughters and sisters in the
abode of rustic innocence; and to hear
them at the grave of their common ancestor
vow to their former play-mates,
that they should ever hold their relationship
as the most close and precious, though
the whole universe should unite in endeavouring
to efface the recollection of it
from their minds.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell’s children could not understand
rightly, what their supposed sisters meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>by such assurances; and the Abbot
thought it unnecessary to explain to them
a mystery, which their approaching separation
from the young Countesses of Werdenberg
would soon make sufficiently clear.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Abbot was obliged to be more communicative
with the Domina of Engelberg.
He found no great difficulty in
obtaining her permission, that Mary (or
Constantia, as she was now called, while
Rosanna resumed her baptismal name of
Ida.... Yes, Elizabeth! Ida and Constantia
were their <i>real</i> names!) that Mary
should for a time make trial of a worldly
life, and should postpone her adoption of
the veil till after the unravelling of her
destiny. Three conditions however were
annexed to the permission; first, that in
case her call to a religious profession should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>be confirmed, that she should pronounce
her vows in no other Convent than Engelberg;
secondly, that in remembrance
of her cloister-duties she should always
wear the habit of the Order; lastly, that
in case of the worst (by which the pious
lady meant an union with an earthly bridegroom)
she should not assume a worldly
dress till her wedding-day, and should
purchase the permission of renouncing the
veil by a handsome benefaction to the
Convent of Engelberg. The abbot understood
the manners of the cloister, and
agreed to these conditions on behalf of his
wards; who in the mean while heaved
many a sigh, while preparing for a journey,
from which their hearts boded no
good.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the sphere in which they now moved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>every thing appeared strange to them, and
consequently disagreeable, from their not
being accustomed to such manners and
appearances. The splendour of Bishop Sigisbert’s
court (at which they now resided)
was too dazzling to be pleasant to
eyes, which were only used to admire the
simple charms of Nature; and when compared
with those scenes, in which their
childhood had past so happily, everything
which now offered itself to their notice
seemed ridiculous and frequently disgusting.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Bishop, who felt the greater interest
in the welfare of his young wards on
account of their simplicity and want of
relish for the dissipations of the world,
was soon obliged to consent to their retiring
from his court, and taking refuge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>in the tranquillity of a Convent at Zurich.
Here Constantia was perfectly at ease; but
Ida, who had been always accustomed to
liberty, was but half satisfied with the restraints
of her abode. Nay, she would
have found them insupportable, had not
the recollection of Erwin Melthal followed
her to the Convent, and made solitude
and silence agreeable, by suffering her to
indulge unrestrained the melancholy of
her heart. In truth, Ida had so little of
that lofty spirit, which should have been
united with her lofty station, that the remembrance
of the son of an humble peasant,
who had perished as an undistinguished
warrior, still was sacred to her
affection; and often did she assure Constantia,
that were he still in existence, she
would rather have renounced her birth-right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>than the hope of being one day called
his wife.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I concealed my rank from Erwin,”
said she, “that his love might not take
the alarm at hearing the proud title of the
Countess of Werdenberg: but I will not
conceal the affection which I felt, and still
feel for this Erwin, this humble peasant’s
son, this undistinguished warrior, from
any one, should any one hereafter think
proper to demand my hand. No! I will
avow my passion openly and firmly; and
doubtless this confession will be enough to
make my noble suitors abandon a girl,
whose folly sets so little value on illustrious
birth and titles handed down by a
long line of ancestors.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Constantia was a little embarrassed in
answering these declarations. Not being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>in love, she could not easily reconcile the
union of two such names as Erwin Melthal,
and Ida, Countess of Werdenberg:
yet still she could not efface from her memory
the solemn vows, which had passed
between them; and in particular she
could not but lay great stress upon their
having been affianced before the altar of
St. Engeltruda; a transaction, in which
she had herself borne so principal a part.
However the sum of her reflections was
(though the goodness of her heart made
her sigh, as she confest it) that it was fortunate,
that Erwin’s death had solved all
the difficulties, which would otherwise
have arisen; and she could not but fancy,
that in this event she saw the hand of
Providence, which had preserved from
degradation the honour of the illustrious
House of Werdenberg.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>In the mean while the Bishop and Abbot
Conrad were consulting, how they
might best advance the interests of their
young favourites. As they were not influenced
by the prejudices, which made
the late Countess of Werdenberg refuse all
intercourse with the family of Torrenburg,
and as they laid no stress upon the
before-mentioned prophecy, they soon
agreed to take the straight road (which
indeed is always the best) and make the
generous Frederick of Torrenburg immediately
acquainted with the existence and
adventures of his long-forgotten relations.
The Count was old, and without children;
and it was not unlikely, that he would
adopt these orphans, and bring them up
as the future heiresses of his domains.
Under this impression they set forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>for his Castle, well provided with letters
and other documents to establish the veracity
of their assertions.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Abbot has been heard to say, that
when the Count was first informed of the
nature of their embassy, he started and
turned pale; as the Bishop proceeded and
made the fact certain beyond the possibility
of dispute, this paleness gave place to
a burning crimson, and when the tale was
finished, the Count sat for a few moments
lost in silent meditation; circumstances,
from which the friends of the two Sisters
augured nothing good to their cause. The
event however proved that they were mistaken
in imagining, that the generous
Frederick would wilfully close his eyes
against a truth, because it was unpleasant
to him; though what made it so unpleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>to him, they were then at a loss to
conceive.</p>

<p class='c018'>He bestowed a noble heart-drawn sigh
upon the memory of the Countess of
Werdenberg. He blamed her for having
suffered her prejudices to interfere so
much with the welfare of her daughters,
and engaged to repair the injury, which
she had done them. Accompanied by the
two Prelates he hastened to the Convent
of Zurich, and entreated his new-found
relations to make his abode their own.
Deep was the emotion exprest in his honest
countenance, when he first saw the
Sisters. In them he beheld renewed in
their most brilliant colours the charms of
their mother, whom he had loved so
long and so dearly without success; and
he clasped them to his bosom with tears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>which he vainly struggled to conceal. The
girls too felt their hearts attracted towards
the excellent man, and found no difficulty
in considering him in every respect as their
father.</p>

<p class='c018'>They followed him to his Castle with
willingness, were grateful for the kindness
which he showed them, nor did it ever
enter their thoughts, that it was in his
power to show them more: but the Bishop
was extremely surprised, that although
the Count had acknowledged the validity
of the documents which testified their
birth, and had adopted them as his nieces,
he made no mention of their being entitled
to any part of his inheritance, nor
seemed to have it in his contemplation to
bestow them on proper bridegrooms.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“The little eagerness,” said the Abbot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>“which the Count shows for the
wedding of his nieces confirms the report,
that he is thinking of one for himself. I
have already heard it whispered, that he
is attached to a young person, with whom
we are both well acquainted. She is lovely
and virtuous; nobody can blame Count
Frederick’s choice, though perhaps some
people may blame him for making at his
time of life any choice at all.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I am sorry to hear this,” replied
the Bishop; “should children spring from
this union, the claims of our wards will be
completely annihilated.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“In which case will they be made
unhappy?” said the Abbot (who thought
liberally on the subject, and to whom the
lady, on whom the Count’s choice was
supposed to have fallen, was even more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>dear than Constantia and her sister).—“Their
rank is acknowledged; the
sums left by their mother in our charge
are sufficient to secure them against absolute
want; their desires are moderate;
neither will Frederick’s generosity fail to
provide for them in a manner suitable to
their station. But to expect that he should
sacrifice the point, on which he grounds
the happiness of his whole future life, in
order that his inheritance may descend
unimpaired to these unexpected newcomers,
is really more than I can possibly
justify to myself.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>This conversation was communicated to
the Sisters: they heard it with indifference.
They were too little acquainted
with the world to think much about events,
which might affect their future interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>and were too grateful to their benefactor
to wish for more favours from him, than
such as he could grant without injury to
his own feelings. But had they known
on <i>whom</i> their uncle’s choice had fallen,
they would have offered up their most
fervent prayers for the success of his suit;
and would have looked forward to the
wedding-day with as much heart-felt pleasure,
as to any which they had ever witnessed,
while they were still the daughters
of old Tell and Inhabitants of the happy
Vale of Rutelis.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the circle of young women, with
whom their near relationship to the Count
of Torrenburg necessarily brought them
acquainted, none attracted their affection
so strongly, as the beautiful Elizabeth of
March. The interest, which Ida felt for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>this charming stranger was shortly reciprocal:
yet it is probable, that Constantia
would in the end have obtained the largest
share of Elizabeth’s friendship and confidence,
on account of that winning softness
of manner and gentleness of temper,
which made her a much more universal
favourite than her gay and thoughtless
sister, had she not thought proper to retire
for a while from the world not long
after the commencement of her acquaintance
with Elizabeth. In spite of Ida’s remonstrances,
Constantia entreated her
uncle to suffer her to pass some time in
the Convent of Zurich, and easily obtained
her request.</p>

<p class='c018'>It seems, that lovely as were the Ladies
of Werdenberg, and general as was the
admiration which they excited, still there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>was not so violent a contest for the possession
of their hands, as the good Bishop
had expected. It was known, that they
were dowerless orphans; and as their uncle’s
marriage (though not publicly spoken
of) was much circulated in whispers, this
event, which was likely to annihilate at
once all the lofty claims of the Sisters,
made their admirers think it to the full as
prudent to confine their admiration for
the present to their own breasts. The
gentle Constantia alone found in the young
Count of Thuringia one, who would have
chosen her as his bride, had she been still
the daughter of the peasant Tell. Constantia
on her side felt, how generous was
the youth’s conduct, and could not doubt
the sincerity of his love: her heart inclined
her to listen to him: but she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>not consent to break her religious determinations
so quickly and so lightly; and
she retired into the Convent, that she
might at least weigh the matter maturely,
and try her suitor’s patience and perseverance
a little by the test of time.</p>

<p class='c018'>After her departure, the friendship of
Elizabeth and Ida acquired strength daily;
though their intercourse was much restricted
by Count Frederick’s evident dissatisfaction
at it, which the unsuspecting
Ida attributed to some unaccountable antipathy
conceived by her uncle against her
lovely friend. The fact was, that with all
his excellent qualities the Count was not
without his weaknesses; among the chief
of which maybe reckoned suspicion, bigotry,
and a fondness for mystery even in the
most innocent things. The last induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>him carefully to conceal the proposals
which (under the seal of secrecy) he had
laid before Elizabeth’s father: the first,
made him fancy, that Ida had fathomed his
purpose, and from interested motives had
endeavoured to set her friend against him;
and his superstitious enthusiasm led him to
believe that the best means of obtaining
Elizabeth’s heart and hand was to tell his
rosary more frequently than ever, and bestow
enormous donations on the Church.
He gave much; he promised more; and
those promises were not breathed in inattentive
ears. The Count’s domestic Priest
and the chaplain of the March family found,
that their own advantage was concerned
in the accomplishment of Count Frederick’s
wishes; and they held many a secret
and serious conference on the means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>of bringing about this union. Besides
the grand inducement of avarice, Father
Hilarius (so was the priest of Torrenburg
named) had additional motives for action.
He looked on the Damsels of Werdenberg
with all that aversion, which old family-servants
ever bear to new-comers; whom
they generally consider as intruders, and
whom they fear, lest by <i>their</i> influence
their own should be diminished. But
with most invincible antipathy did the
Monk regard the gay and thoughtless Ida,
who had sometimes indulged her mirth at
his expence, and whom he was determined
to expel from her uncle’s heart, whatever
trouble it might cost him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Elizabeth by this time had no secrets
for Ida. She informed her, that her parents
had promised her hand to a powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>nobleman, and had ordered her in the most
peremptory manner to prepare for the reception
of her future husband, without
even condescending to inform her of his
name or situation. However, she was in
truth little curious respecting him, for her
heart was already bestowed upon another.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Yes!” said she to Ida, “I love
Count Henry of Montfort, and have
every reason to believe, that I am beloved
in return most sincerely. Be this unknown
bridegroom whom he may, he
will find himself only an object of aversion
in the eyes of Elizabeth of March.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida, judging by her own attachment to
the deceased Erwin, agreed, that to banish
from the heart the image of an adored
lover was quite impossible: and Elizabeth
was so well-pleased with her friend’s mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>of reasoning, that she embraced her with
redoubled affection. Ida advised her by
no means to give up Count Henry; and
Elizabeth on the other hand promised solemnly
to follow that advice, which was
so perfectly in unison with her own inclinations.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I am grieved to think,” said Elizabeth,
“that probably in future we shall
be suffered to meet but seldom! I have
already received some hints, that my parents
suspect you of not giving me such
counsels, as they could wish; and yet in
the present situation of my affairs it is so
necessary for me to possess some feeling
heart, to whom I can apply for sympathy
and advice!—However, we shall still be
able to correspond privately; and those
communications may be made in writing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>which the enemies of our friendship forbid
us to impart in conversation.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida unluckily knew nothing of the art
of writing on her first arrival at the Castle
of Torrenburg; and since that time she
had made but little progress under the tuition
of Father Hilarius. She blushed,
while she confest this ignorance; however,
on examination Elizabeth was of
opinion, that her friend was already sufficiently
advanced to answer all necessary
purposes.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I shall require no circumstantial
answers from you,” said she; “a single
expressive word will be enough to convey
to me your opinion of my situation, and
guide me in my difficulties: a “yes” or
“no” will in general be sufficient to decide
my conduct. On my side, I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>take care to write so large a hand that it can
be easily read, and to express myself in a
manner that shall be intelligible only to
yourself. Then if you are <i>quite</i> at a loss
respecting any part of my letters, you
may show the isolated passage to your
chaplain Father Hilarius. He is a simple
good kind of man, whose understanding
is not keen enough to pierce through our
mystery, and who may easily be deceived
by two young girls with all their wits
about them.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>This “simple good kind of man,” as
Elizabeth called him, the pious Father
Hilarius, was perfectly astonished at the
diligence, with which Ida now prosecuted
her studies under his direction. Hitherto
he had found her a very inattentive pupil,
and as long as his lessons lasted, Ida
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>was accustomed to yawn without intermission:
on a sudden she was seized with
the greatest fondness for that, which hitherto
had inspired her with nothing but
disgust: she even requested, that an additional
hour’s instruction might be allowed
her every day; and as Father Hilarius
was not <i>quite</i> so simple as the girls had
imagined, he concluded, that there must
be some secret cause for this unexpected
love of literature. An epistolary intercourse,
arising from some love-affair, naturally
suggested itself to his mind; and
he determined to watch with the eyes of
an Argus, whether he could not make
some discovery to the prejudice of his detested
pupil.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida soon received a pressing invitation
to visit Elizabeth; the Count’s permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>was requested; but as he was now on the
point of declaring himself, and conceived
that the presence of his lineal heiress could
by no means be advantageous to his suit,
that permission was refused. Elizabeth
therefore had recourse to her pen, and
Ida soon received the following letter.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“I told you, that I had every reason
to think that he loved me: alas! I fear,
that I deceived myself. He knows my
situation; knows, how I am persecuted;
and yet he offers no friendly advice for my
relief, nay even seems to decline every
opportunity of visiting the Castle. He is
at present with his uncle, who is too
closely connected with my parents to favour
an attachment, which would disappoint
their views. Perhaps, he even insists
upon Henry’s giving up every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>thought of me!—The bridegroom of my
father’s choice has not yet revealed himself:
I am still ignorant of all, except that
he is rich, powerful, and <i>old</i>; but I am
threatened with his speedy arrival, and
have been assured, that the day in which
I am presented to him, shall be that of
my nuptials.—Write to me, dear Ida, and
say, what course I should follow: the
danger is urgent.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>The messenger, who brought this letter,
waited for an answer: it was with infinite
difficulty, that Ida contrived to
scrawl the following words.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Write to your Henry: if he loves
you, he will hasten to your relief.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Several letters followed the foregoing;
though Ida was frequently unable to decypher
whole sentences of Elizabeth’s, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Elizabeth was sometimes completely at a
loss to guess the meaning of Ida’s pot-hooks.
But the next letter of any consequence
ran as follows—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Though he is the friend of my parents,
my lover’s uncle is not my enemy.
He read the letter which I addrest to
Henry, and permitted him to obey it.
Henry has done so: Henry is here, and
says that he is come to save me: but
how?—Many a bold resolution presents
itself to my thoughts, but all are too desperate
to be adopted without advice. Decide
for me, my friend; I will follow your
judgment implicitly.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>To this, Ida answered—“Fly with your
Henry, and take refuge in his uncle’s
Castle. In <i>your</i> situation, <i>I</i> would not have
hesitated to follow Erwin through the
world!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>This reply was not received, till the
Count of Torrenburg had been presented
to Elizabeth as the man, to whom her
hand was destined. The repugnance, with
which she listened to his declaration, was
too visible to escape his notice; but as
her parents gave him the most solemn assurances,
that her heart (though not yet
disposed in his favour) was still free from
any other attachment, he persisted in his
addresses. He persuaded himself, that his
assiduities must in the end make him
master of her affections, if once her hand
became his property; and he looked forward
with impatience to the nuptial-day,
which was already fixed, and at no great
distance.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida’s reply arriving at this critical moment,
produced a rejoinder from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>friend, which put her in no slight embarrassment;
for the greatest part of it was
totally unintelligible to her. Of Elizabeth’s
former letters she had frequently
failed in decyphering the <i>words</i>; but in
the present epistle, even where she had
overcome that difficulty, the <i>sense</i> frequently
appeared to her as obscure as
ever.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Ah! my sweet friend! how precious
should I esteem your last advice,
could I but be certain, that in giving it
you were prompted by no motive but affection
for Me. You cannot be ignorant,
that all mystery is now laid aside; the
dreaded bridegroom is arrived; and
doubtless <i>you</i> must have been made aware
of his intentions, long before my parents
thought proper to communicate them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>myself. When therefore you counsel me
to shun this marriage by flight, can I
avoid apprehending lest <i>interest</i>.... Ah!
forgive me these suspicions, dear Ida! I
will not doubt the sincerity of your
friendship.—Yet flight is difficult, dangerous,
disgraceful; Henry himself is unwilling
to resort to this clandestine means of
rescue! On the other hand, this hated
Bridegroom.... Why do they tell me of
his wealth and power? What are they to
<i>me</i>? What are the domains of Carlsheim,
Torrenburg, and Sargans, when balanced
against Henry’s heart?—I know not what
to do!—Once more, dear Ida! but <i>once</i>
more advise me! Lay aside every interested
motive, which might prompt your
counselling me to flight; assure me, that
friendship alone dictates your decision;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>and then if you still bid me trust my fate
to Henry, I will throw myself into his
arms, and bid adieu to the Castle of
March.... alas! perhaps for ever!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Again and again did Ida read this letter,
and still found herself as far as ever from
understanding it. She would gladly have
submitted it to some more learned head
than her own; but her sister was absent,
and prudence forbade her communicating
it to the chaplain. Above all, the line
which contained the three difficult words
“<i>Torrenburg</i>,” “<i>Carlsheim</i>,” and “<i>Sargans</i>”
set all her skill at defiance; and
she could not but fancy, that were she
once mistress of the meaning of that one
line, it would make the rest of the letter
quite intelligible.—And then what harm
could there be in showing a stranger that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>single passage? The reader would certainly
be able to gain but little information
from it; and arguing thus, she cut the
passage out of the letter, and hastened to
request Father Hilarius to give her the interpretation.</p>

<p class='c018'>Father Hilarius (whose activity was quite
indefatigable, when exerted to find out
what could injure his enemies, among
whom he numbered the innocent Ida) already
suspected the secret correspondence
between his pupil and Elizabeth. The
subject of it, however, was still unknown
to him; but now the whole was as clear
as day-light. He read what was shown to
him, guest the remainder, and malicious
pleasure sparkled in his eyes. To put the
matter beyond a doubt, he pretended,
that it was impossible to understand the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>meaning of a passage so detached, and demanded
a sight of the whole epistle. This,
however, was refused him: upon which he
declared it to be his opinion, that “the
difficult words in question must be Greek;
for <i>his</i> part, he could make neither head
nor tail of them.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida went away out of all patience!
However, as she could not discover, that
her friend’s situation had undergone any
material alteration since her last letter, she
at length determined at all events to send
her the same answer: accordingly the
messenger was despatched with a note
containing only——“Flight! instant
flight.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida’s belief, that the bands of love once
formed could never be broken (together
with other romantic notions, which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>had imbibed among the Helvetian mountains,
respecting justice and injustice, liberty
of the heart, and suitability in marriage)
must plead her excuse for the rash
advice, which in the simplicity of her nature
she gave her friend; advice, which
afterwards operated to her prejudice so
strongly, that it nearly ruined her reputation
and her whole happiness in life. She
counselled Elizabeth to take that step
which (had she been herself the heroine of
the adventure) she would herself undoubtedly
have taken: this was the utmost
extent of her error; this, and no more!</p>

<p class='c018'>The advice was given; the advice was
followed. A few days elapsed, and she
heard, that the whole country was in an
uproar. The beautiful Elizabeth of March
had eloped with Henry of Montfort; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>her brother Oswald, assisted by the forces
of the Count of Torrenburg, had set forward
in pursuit of the fugitives.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida was delighted to find, that her advice
had been carried into execution with
so much success: she only feared, lest the
lovers should be overtaken by their pursuers,
among whom she grieved to hear
her uncle numbered; she was still ignorant,
how deeply he was interested in this
affair, and concluded that he was actuated
to take a part in it by the friendship,
which had so long subsisted between himself
and the old Count of March.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her prayers and wishes were half accomplished,
half rejected. The lovers
were overtaken: but Count Oswald of
March was fondly attached to his sister;
some well-disposed persons kindly interfered;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>Count Frederick voluntarily resigned
his pretensions; and it was finally
resolved, that the errors of love should
be pardoned, and the fugitives united in a
public and customary manner. In truth,
no one could deny, that Henry was a
much more suitable partner for the blooming
Elizabeth, than her destined bridegroom,
the age-stricken Count of Torrenburg.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ida was not long without hearing from
her friend: this letter, (the last which
she ever received from Elizabeth,) induced
her to take a step, which filled up
the measure of her mischances, and not
only deprived her of the favour of her deceived
uncle, but totally ruined her in the
general opinion.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Ida! dear Ida! authoress of all my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>present happiness! How wise was your
advice! How perfectly has it succeeded!
Yet a few days, and I shall become the wife
of Henry.  Still I shall feel my pleasure
incomplete, unless I can thank you for it
with an embrace on my bridal-day. Come
then, my friend! come to place the garland
on my brow<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, and rejoice in the work
of your prudence! You will find your
sister with me: it was easy for her to obtain
a dispensation from her Abbess. I
rejoice, that your uncle is now in a distant
part of the country, as in the present
moment you would certainly have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>refused permission to come to me. As it
is, resolve to brave the hazard of a few
frowns at his return; he will soon forget
his displeasure at your witnessing my
nuptials, being totally ignorant of every
thing which might seriously make him offended
with you, and which (you may be
assured) shall never come to his knowledge.—But
though concealed from all
others, the friendly part which you have
acted in this business, shall never be forgotten
by the grateful heart of your Elizabeth.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This alludes to a custom still preserved in many
parts of Germany: the bride wears a myrtle-wreath
during the nuptial-ceremony, and it is usual
for her on the day after her marriage to present this
wreath to that female friend, to whom she is most
attached.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>“Then haste to me, my friend! I
burn with impatience to make my Henry
known to you: he too is impatient to see
the friend of his Betrothed, the kind adviser,
to whom the Happy-ones owe their
happiness.  I have resolved, that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>wished-for introduction shall take place at
the altar, before which I am to pronounce
the nuptial vow. I confess, this decision
is in some degree dictated by selfish motives:
were Henry to see the lovely Ida of
Werdenberg, before it is too late for him to
retract with honour, who knows but her
charms might make him faithless to the less
fair Elizabeth?—Ah! dearest Ida, you are
conscious, that I do but jest; I know well
the heart of my friend, and the honour of
my lover! Forgive then the fantastic humours
of a girl already half wild with her
happiness, and refuse not to make by your
presence that happiness still greater.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>A great part of this letter was as little
understood by Ida as the former one;
however, she took good care not to employ
the Chaplain to explain the meaning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>She doubted not his opposing her departure
for the Castle of March, since her
uncle (though for what reason she could
not imagine) would disapprove of her visit;
and in the Count’s absence she was
totally under the direction of Father Hilarius.
Ida therefore contented herself
with understanding from the letter, that
she was invited to a wedding, at which
the successful counsels which she had
given (together with other friendly services
which she had rendered the happy
pair) would make <i>her</i> an important personage;
at which she should meet her
sister Constantia, and doubtless many
other of her youthful friends; and where
she should exhibit her beauty to the best
advantage, and should dress, dance, sing,
and laugh, as she had frequently done on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>similar occasions on the blooming lawn
of Rutelis. This was enough for her to
know, and to determine her proceedings.
On the appointed day Elizabeth sent a
small body of attendants to wait for her
friend in a wood at no great distance from
the Castle of Torrenburg. Ida failed not
to join them there; and without bidding
adieu to Father Hilarius, she very quietly
set forward for the Castle of March.</p>

<p class='c018'>She reached it in safety, and soon found
herself clasped in the arms of her delighted
friend. There too she had the happiness
of once more embracing Constantia.
The two Sisters past the intervening time
between their arrival and the wedding-day
with Elizabeth in her apartment;
where (according to the custom of our
times) on such occasions no man was permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>to show himself, not even the
bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c018'>The important day arrived. Followed
by her lovely companions, herself the
most lovely, Elizabeth with trembling
steps and a fluttering heart approached
the altar, where Henry of Montfort waited
her arrival. Ida now stepped forward;
she threw back her veil, and prepared to
fasten the wreath of Innocence among the
golden ringlets of her friend: a similar
garland hung on her arm, with which she
was afterwards to present the bridegroom.
Occupied entirely with the task of decorating
Elizabeth, she had not yet cast her
eyes on young Montfort; she had not
observed, that he started on beholding her;
she had not heard the name of “<i>Rosanna</i>,”
which escaped from his trembling lips. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>now turned to him for the purpose of offering
him the other wreath; she already
extended her hand; when fixing her eyes
on his countenance, she uttered a cry expressive
at once of the utmost surprise
and terror, attempted but in vain to pronounce
the name of Erwin Melthal, and
would have sank upon the ground, had
not Constantia rushed forward and received
her in her supporting arms.</p>

<p class='c018'>Constantia still wore the habit of a Nun;
the altar was adorned exactly in the same
manner, and the blazing lamps shed the
same mysterious light along the fretted
roots and gloomy arches, as on that day
when Erwin and Rosanna knelt at the
shrine of St. Engeltruda, poured forth
the most solemn vows of eternal fidelity,
and heard Constantia devote the breaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>of those vows to unceasing shame and
sorrow.—Erwin Melthal (or rather Henry
of Montfort, for alas! they formed but
one) had long believed the lovely Sisters
to be no more the inhabitants of earth:
Constantia on the other hand was in the
same error respecting Erwin. The sudden
appearance of one, whom she had long
since numbered with the dead, imprest
upon her countenance something of that
serious, that strangely awful expression,
which struck him so forcibly, when she
united his hand with Rosanna’s in the
Chapel of Engelberg. He recollected her
words—“Should either of you rend
asunder the bonds, with which I now unite
your fates for ever, that instant shall my
form (be I living, or be I dead) stand before
you threatening and awful, to reproach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>you with your crimes.”—These
recollections, and the unexpected appearance
of the Sisters, at the very
moment when he was on the point of
giving his hand to another, made him
consider the whole scene as a supernatural
vision! He believed, that the forms
which stood before him, were creatures
of another world; his brain was unable to
support the shock; the surrounding objects
floated before his eyes, his senses
forsook him, and he sank without animation
at the feet of his astonished bride.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
